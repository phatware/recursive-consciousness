# Recursive Consciousness

Jupyter notebook in this folder implements a simple test of recursive consciousness model for debugging code. It uses a combination of LLMs (Large Language Models) and structured data to analyze and improve code functions iteratively. The script is designed to be modular, allowing for easy integration with different LLMs and data sources.

For details, see the [debugger](debugger.md).

For the theory behind the design, see the [Recursive Consciousness](../RecursiveConsciousness.md) document.

## Using Notebooks

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Required libraries installed (see `requirements.txt` in the root directory)
- A valid OpenAI API key for the LLM service or access to a local LLM instance

### Running the Notebooks

After installing the required libraries and setting up your environment, you can run the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Each notebook contains code cells that can be executed sequentially. You can modify the code and re-run cells to test different scenarios or configurations.
