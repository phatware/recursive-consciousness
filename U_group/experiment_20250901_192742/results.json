    "[Query] What are the key principles of effective machine learning model evaluation?",
    "[A3 Question]: Do you want a domain-agnostic, high-level framework for evaluating ML models, or domain- and model-specific guidance (e.g., for tabular supervised learning, image/NLP models, time-series) with particular deployment constraints?",
    "[A5 Answer]: I recommend a domain-agnostic, high-level framework for evaluating ML models. It provides a consistent, reusable set of principles you can apply across domains (tabular, image, NLP, time-series, etc.) and then tailor to your specific problem and deployment constraints.\n\nKey principles and components\n\n1) Define objectives and success criteria\n- Clearly state the business or mission goals, primary success metric, and acceptable trade-offs (e.g., precision vs. recall, false positives vs. false negatives).\n- Identify deployment constraints (latency, memory, budget, privacy, regulatory requirements).\n\n2) Data management and evaluation setup\n- Use appropriate data splits: train/validation/test; consider time-aware splits for time-series; avoid leakage from future data.\n- If feasible, include out-of-distribution or domain-shift scenarios in evaluation (e.g., new user cohorts, seasonality shifts).\n- Establish a robust baseline(s) for comparison.\n\n3) Metric selection and multi-metric reporting\n- Align metrics with the objective and problem type:\n  - Classification: accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC; calibration metrics (Brier score, reliability diagrams); decision-threshold analysis.\n  - Regression: RMSE, MAE, R^2, MAPE; residual analysis.\n  - Ranking: NDCG, MAP, Kendall/Tau.\n  - Multiclass/ordinal: per-class metrics, macro/micro averages.\n- Include both primary metric and informative secondary metrics, plus confidence intervals (e.g., bootstrap) to quantify uncertainty.\n- Report calibration and reliability where probabilistic outputs are used.\n\n4) Robustness, reliability, and generalization\n- Test for robustness to distribution shift (covariate shift, label shift) and adversarial perturbations where relevant.\n- Evaluate model calibration across subgroups and operating regimes.\n- Perform error analysis to identify systematic failure modes.\n\n5) Fairness, accountability, and bias considerations\n- Define relevant sensitive attributes and fairness objectives (e.g., equalized odds, disparate impact, demographic parity, or task-specific fairness).\n- Evaluate metrics across subgroups; assess intersectional groups; consider causal or counterfactual approaches if appropriate.\n- Document remediation options and trade-offs if biases are found.\n\n6) Interpretability and explainability\n- Use global and local explanations (feature importance, SHAP/LIME, attention maps) as appropriate.\n- Ensure explanations are faithful and useful for stakeholders; track how explanations map to decisions.\n\n7) Operational performance and resource constraints\n- Measure latency, throughput, memory usage, and hardware requirements under realistic load.\n- Assess energy/computational costs and consider model compression or distillation if needed.\n\n8) Reliability, monitoring, and lifecycle\n- Plan for drift detection (data and concept drift), retraining triggers, and versioning.\n- Define monitoring dashboards and alerting for key metrics and data quality.\n- Document rollback and rollback testing procedures; have a clear deployment strategy (canary, blue/green).\n\n9) Reproducibility, governance, and documentation\n- Use fixed seeds, controlled environments, and containerized deployments.\n- Version data, features, and models; track experiments and results systematically.\n- Produce evaluation reports, model cards, and decision records.\n\n10) Domain-specific tailoring (optional, if needed)\n- If you want, I can tailor this high-level framework to a specific domain or model family (e.g., tabular supervised learning, computer vision, NLP, time-series) and to your deployment constraints (edge devices, real-time latency, privacy requirements).\n\nIf you’d like, tell me your domain (e.g., tabular data, images, text, time-series), dataset size, latency/memory constraints, and any fairness or regulatory considerations, and I’ll customize the framework with concrete metrics, evaluation procedures, and a checklist.",
    "[A2 Question]: Would you prefer a compact, domain-agnostic checklist of 5–7 principles, or a structured, step-by-step evaluation plan (data splits, metric set, baselines, and monitoring) that you can apply directly?",
    "[A1 Answer]: Structured, step-by-step evaluation plan (actionable and directly applicable)\n\n- Step 0: Define objectives and constraints\n  - State the primary business/mission objective, success metric, acceptable trade-offs, and deployment constraints (latency, memory, privacy, budget, regulatory requirements).\n\n- Step 1: Data management and evaluation setup\n  - Specify data splits: train/validation/test; use time-aware splits for time-series; ensure no leakage from future data.\n  - Include robustness checks: plan for out-of-distribution or domain-shift scenarios (new cohorts, seasonality, event-driven changes).\n  - Establish robust baselines for comparison (simple models, previous systems, or heuristic approaches).\n\n- Step 2: Metric selection and multi-metric reporting\n  - Choose primary metric aligned with the objective (e.g., accuracy/ROC-AUC for classification, RMSE/MAE for regression, NDCG for ranking).\n  - Include relevant secondary metrics: precision, recall, F1, calibration metrics (Brier score, reliability diagrams), decision-threshold analyses, as appropriate.\n  - Report uncertainty: confidence intervals via bootstrap or other resampling; per-subgroup metrics if fairness or robustness is a concern.\n\n- Step 3: Baselines, experiments, and statistical rigor\n  - Compare against strong baselines and perform ablations to isolate component contributions.\n  - Use consistent experimental design (fixed seeds, identical preprocessing where possible); consider statistical tests when comparing models.\n\n- Step 4: Robustness, fairness, and reliability checks\n  - Test robustness to distribution shifts (covariate/label shift) and, where relevant, adversarial perturbations.\n  - Evaluate fairness across sensitive attributes and subgroups; analyze intersectional groups; document trade-offs and remediation options.\n\n- Step 5: Calibration and interpretability\n  - Assess probabilistic calibration if outputs are used as probabilities; provide calibration plots and metrics.\n  - Generate explanations (global and local) appropriate to stakeholders (feature importance, SHAP/LIME, or model-specific explanations).\n\n- Step 6: Operational performance and deployment constraints\n  - Measure latency, throughput, memory usage, and hardware requirements under realistic load.\n  - Assess energy and compute costs; plan for potential model compression or distillation if needed.\n\n- Step 7: Reliability, monitoring, and lifecycle planning\n  - Define drift detection for data and concepts; establish retraining triggers and versioning strategy.\n  - Set up monitoring dashboards, alerts for key metrics and data quality, and rollback procedures.\n\n- Step 8: Reproducibility, governance, and documentation\n  - Fix seeds, control environments, and containerize deployments; version data, features, and models.\n  - Produce evaluation reports, model cards, and decision records to support governance.\n\n- Step 9: Reporting and decision criteria\n  - Predefine success criteria and stop rules; document final model selection rationale and deployment plan.\n\nIf you want, I can tailor this step-by-step plan to your domain (e.g., tabular, image, NLP, time-series) and your specific constraints (edge latency, privacy, regulatory requirements).",
    "[A2 Question]: Would you like the step-by-step evaluation plan to be domain-agnostic with generic metrics and placeholders, or should I tailor it to a specific domain you’re working with (e.g., tabular data, computer vision, NLP, or time-series) and include concrete domain-specific metrics, data splits, and baselines?",
    "[A1 Answer]: I recommend tailoring the step-by-step evaluation plan to your specific domain (tabular, image, NLP, time-series) with concrete domain-specific metrics, data splits, and baselines. This ensures the metrics, splitting strategy, and baselines align with how the problem is actually evaluated in practice and with any domain-driven constraints (e.g., latency for real-time vision, regulatory fairness considerations for lending).\n\nWhat I need from you:\n- The domain (e.g., tabular supervised learning, computer vision, NLP, time-series).\n- Any deployment constraints (latency, memory, edge vs. cloud) and regulatory/fairness considerations.\n- An example dataset or problem type (optional but helpful for concrete baselines).\n\nIf you’d prefer, I can proceed with a domain-agnostic plan now and then swap in domain-specific details once you specify the domain.",

    "[A4 Question]: Which domain are you focusing on (tabular, image, NLP, or time-series), and what is your top deployment constraint (e.g., latency/throughput targets, memory footprint, edge vs. cloud, or privacy/regulatory requirements) that I should tailor the plan to?",
    "[A5 Answer]: Please specify the two items so I can tailor the plan:\n\n- Domain: tabular, image, NLP, or time-series (or another domain you’re working in)\n- Top deployment constraint: \n  - Latency/throughput target (e.g., inference time ≤ X ms, requests per second ≥ Y)\n  - Memory footprint (e.g., ≤ Z MB)\n  - Edge vs. cloud deployment\n  - Privacy/regulatory requirements (e.g., data cannot leave certain regions, strict auditing)\n  - Or a combination of the above\n\nOptional but helpful:\n- Example dataset/problem type (e.g., credit-scoring tabular, CIFAR-10 image classification, sentiment analysis NLP, stock-price time-series)\n- Hardware context (CPU vs. GPU, any accelerators)\n- Any fairness/regulatory considerations you need to address\n\nOnce you provide these, I’ll deliver a concrete, domain-specific step-by-step evaluation plan with exact metrics, data splits, baselines, and monitoring tailored to your constraints.",

    "[A5 Answer]: Domain-specific, step-by-step evaluation plan tailored to tabular (structured) data with latency/throughput as the primary deployment constraint.\n\nPlan outline (ready to fill with your exact targets)\n\n1) Define objectives and constraints\n- Objective: primary business/mission metric (e.g., ROC-AUC for classification, RMSE for regression).\n- Latency/throughput targets: specify target inference time per sample (ms) and desired QPS (or batch size) under realistic load on your target hardware (CPU/GPU, batch processing, or edge).\n\n2) Data management and evaluation setup\n- Data splits: train/validation/test; use time-aware splits if data is time-ordered; ensure no leakage.\n- Rigorous baselines: simple models (logistic regression, linear models) and a strong non-linear baseline (e.g., gradient boosting).\n- Robustness planning: include domain-shift scenarios (e.g., new user segments, seasonality).\n\n3) Metric selection and multi-metric reporting\n- Primary metric by problem type:\n  - Classification: ROC-AUC (primary), PR-AUC, accuracy.\n  - Regression: RMSE or MAE (primary).\n- Secondary metrics: precision, recall, F1; calibration metrics (Brier score, reliability diagrams); per-subgroup metrics if fairness is a concern.\n- Uncertainty: bootstrap confidence intervals; report per-subgroup metrics if relevant.\n\n4) Baselines, experiments, and statistical rigor\n- Consistent experimental design: fixed seeds, identical preprocessing where possible.\n- Ablations to isolate components (e.g., feature engineering, encoding schemes, model complexity).\n- Statistical comparison: apply appropriate tests when comparing models.\n\n5) Robustness, fairness, and reliability checks\n- Robustness: covariate shift, label shift checks; simulate small perturbations to inputs.\n- Fairness/regulatory checks: evaluate performance across sensitive subgroups; quantify trade-offs and document remediation options.\n\n6) Calibration and interpretability\n- Calibration: assess probabilistic outputs if used for decision thresholds; include calibration plots and metrics.\n- Explanations: global feature importance and local explanations (SHAP/LIME) as needed for stakeholders.\n\n7) Operational performance and resource constraints\n- Inference latency per sample at target batch size, memory footprint, and peak CPU/GPU utilization.\n- Throughput under load: QPS or batch throughput; evaluate with realistic batching strategies.\n\n8) Reliability, monitoring, and lifecycle planning\n- Drift detection (data and concept drift); retraining triggers.\n- Monitoring dashboards and alerts for key metrics and data quality.\n- Deployment strategy considerations (canary/blue-green) and rollback plans.\n\n9) Reproducibility, governance, and documentation\n- Fixed seeds, controlled environments, containerization.\n- Versioning for data, features, and models; experiment tracking.\n- Documentation: model cards, evaluation reports, and decision records.\n\n10) Domain-specific tailoring (optional)\n- If you later want, we can tailor to a concrete tabular problem (e.g., credit scoring, fraud detection) with domain-specific preprocessing, feature encoders, and validation procedures.\n\nWhat I need to finalize with concrete targets\n- Latency target per inference (in ms) and batch size or throughput (QPS) for your target hardware.\n- Task type: binary classification, multiclass classification, or regression.\n- Any fairness/regulatory considerations to incorporate in step 5.\n- Example dataset/problem type (optional but helps with ready-to-use baselines).\n\nIf you’d like, I can produce a ready-to-use, domain-specific template for tabular data with placeholders you can fill in (e.g., [LATENCY_MS], [THROUGHPUT_QPS], [CLASSIFICATION/BINARY/REGRESSION], etc.).",
    "[A4 Question]: What is your target latency per inference (in milliseconds) and the required throughput (inferences per second, QPS) for your deployment hardware (e.g., CPU model, memory, and any expected batching), so I can fill in concrete thresholds in the tabular plan?",
    "[A3 Answer]: Great. To fill in concrete thresholds for the tabular plan, I need your deployment details. If you don’t have exact hardware, you can pick a common scenario and I’ll tailor from there. Below are three practical targets for typical tabular deployments, plus a ready-to-fill template you can use.\n\nThree common deployment scenarios (domain: tabular, latency/throughput as primary constraint)\n\n1) Edge / on-device, single-sample inference (no batching)\n- Latency per inference: 20 ms\n- Throughput (inferences per second): 50 QPS\n- Batch size: 1\n- Typical hardware: CPU-only, low-power device (e.g., Cortex-A family), ~2–4 GB RAM\n- Notes: Minimal feature preprocessing; GBM or lightweight linear models often used\n\n2) Cloud real-time inference, small to moderate load (batching not relied upon)\n- Latency per inference: 5 ms\n- Throughput: 200–1000 QPS (for single-sample processing; can scale with more cores)\n- Batch size: 1 (or small batches if you enable batching in serving)\n- Typical hardware: 2–8 vCPUs, 8–16 GB RAM (or equivalent), CPU- or GPU-accelerated serving\n- Notes: Suitable for real-time scoring with modest model complexity (logistic regression, gradient boosting, small DNNs)\n\n3) Batch-oriented or streaming high-throughput\n- Latency per batch: 200 ms (per batch)\n- Throughput: 32–128 samples per batch, yielding QPS ≈ (batch_size) / (latency_per_batch_seconds)\n- Example: batch_size 32, latency 0.20 s → QPS ≈ 160\n- Batch size: 32–128\n- Typical hardware: 8–32 vCPUs or equivalent GPU/TPU; memory scaled to hold batch data\n- Notes: Useful when you can tolerate a small end-to-end latency but need high aggregate throughput\n\nReady-to-fill template (domain-agnostic but tabular-ready)\n\n- Target latency per inference (ms): [____]\n- Target throughput (QPS): [____]\n- Batch size: [____]\n- Deployment hardware (example): [CPU model, number of cores, RAM in GB; GPU if applicable]\n- Expected usage pattern: [edge vs. cloud; real-time vs. batch]\n- Primary model family (roughly): [logistic regression / GBM / neural net / other]\n- Rationale: [brief note on why this target is chosen given constraints]\n\nHow to choose your numbers (quick guidance)\n- If you need real-time decisions on user actions (e.g., fraud scoring, risk scoring, live recommender): target low latency (5–20 ms) and higher QPS (100–1000+), usually on cloud with a strong CPU/GPU or optimized serving.\n- If the system can tolerate slight delays and you process in batches (e.g., nightly scoring, large-scale batch updates): you can set higher per-sample latency but higher aggregate throughput; compute QPS from batch_size / batch_latency_sec.\n- If you’re constrained to edge devices: expect higher per-sample latency (tens of ms to a few hundred ms) and lower QPS; plan for simpler models or aggressive feature engineering to stay within budget.\n\nWhat I need from you to finalize concrete thresholds\n- Which scenario best matches your deployment (edge/on-device, cloud real-time, or batch/high-throughput)? If you don’t know, provide:\n  - Target hardware (CPU model and available RAM, or indicate edge/cloud)\n  - Whether you plan to batch in serving (yes/no and typical batch size)\n  - Any latency or throughput requirements you must meet (in ms per inference and QPS)\n- Task type: binary classification, multiclass classification, or regression (so I can align the primary metric)\n- Any fairness/regulatory considerations to reflect in the plan (optional but helpful)\n\nIf you provide your hardware and whether batching is allowed, I’ll fill in exact numbers in your tabular plan and deliver a ready-to-use, domain-specific evaluation template with concrete thresholds, plus a brief rationale and measurement guidance.",
    "[A5 Question]: Which domain should I tailor the domain-specific evaluation plan to (tabular, image, NLP, or time-series), and what is the single most important deployment constraint I should optimize for (latency/throughput, memory footprint, edge vs. cloud, or privacy/regulatory requirements)?",
    "[A2 Answer]: - Domain: tabular (structured data)\n- Single most important deployment constraint: latency/throughput (real-time or near-real-time inference)\n\nIf you’d like, I can now provide a concrete, ready-to-use domain-specific evaluation plan for tabular data with exact targets (latency in ms, throughput in QPS) and corresponding baselines, data splits, and monitoring checks—just share your target hardware (CPU/GPU, cores, RAM) and desired latency/throughput.",
    "[A4 Question]: Could you specify the exact deployment hardware you’ll target (e.g., edge CPU with X cores and Y GB RAM vs cloud CPU/GPU with Z cores and W GB RAM) so I can set concrete latency and throughput targets accordingly?",
    "[A3 Answer]: Here are concrete, ready-to-use hardware profiles you can pick from (or tailor) for tabular, latency/throughput–driven deployment. Each profile includes target latency, throughput, batch size, and typical model types. If you already have exact hardware, share it and I’ll lock in precise thresholds.\n\nProfile 1 — Edge / on-device (CPU-only)\n- Target hardware: 4-core CPU, 4 GB RAM (e.g., typical embedded edge device)\n- Latency per inference: ~20–40 ms (single sample)\n- Throughput: ~25–50 QPS (single-sample with minimal batching)\n- Batch size: 1\n- Suitable models: Logistic Regression, small Gradient Boosting (LightGBM/XGBoost with limited depth), small linear/SHALLOW NN\n- Notes: Maximize feature preprocessing efficiency; use optimized serving (e.g., ONNXRuntime, batch-unfriendly ops minimized)\n\nProfile 2 — Cloud real-time (CPU)\n- Target hardware: 8 vCPUs, 16 GB RAM\n- Latency per inference: ~5–10 ms (single sample)\n- Throughput: 200–1000 QPS (per-instance, with small batching if supported)\n- Batch size: 1 (or small batches, e.g., 2–4)\n- Suitable models: Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM) with modest depth, small DNNs\n- Notes: Favor efficient model serving stacks; enable batching at the server level if your traffic pattern allows\n\nProfile 3 — Cloud real-time (GPU-accelerated)\n- Target hardware: 8–16 vCPU + 1× GPU (e.g., T4) or 1–2 GPUs; 32 GB RAM\n- Latency per inference: ~1–5 ms (single sample, with optimized kernel)\n- Throughput: ~1000–5000 QPS (single-sample or small batches; higher with batching)\n- Batch size: 4–32 (depending on model and kernel efficiency)\n- Suitable models: Large tabular models with embeddings, medium-to-large DNNs\n- Notes: Requires optimized inference runtime and careful data pre-processing to avoid I/O bottlenecks\n\nProfile 4 — Batch/high-throughput (cloud or data-plane)\n- Target hardware: 32 vCPUs, 128 GB RAM (or equivalent GPU cluster)\n- Latency per batch: ~200 ms per batch\n- Batch size: 32–128\n- Throughput: ~100–1000+ QPS depending on batch size and pipeline\n- Suitable models: Large GBMs, sizeable DNNs, ensembles\n- Notes: Best when you can tolerate end-to-end batching; design for streaming or nightly scoring pipelines\n\nHow to choose quickly\n- Real-time, user-facing decisions with strict latency: pick Profile 1, 2, or 3 depending on whether you need edge, CPU-only, or GPU acceleration.\n- High-volume scoring with some batching tolerance: Profile 3 or Profile 4.\n- If you’re unsure of exact hardware, start with Profile 2 (a common cloud CPU baseline) and adjust once you’ve measured real serving latency.\n\nWhat I need to finalize concrete targets for you\n- Confirm which profile best matches your planned hardware, or provide exact specs:\n  - Edge vs. cloud\n  - CPU cores and RAM (and GPU if any)\n  - Whether batching is allowed in your serving stack\n- Your domain task specifics (binary/multiclass/regression) so I can align the primary metric\n- Any minimum latency or maximum QPS you must meet\n\nIf you share your exact hardware (e.g., “edge: 4-core ARM, 4 GB RAM; cloud: 8 vCPUs, 16 GB RAM, no GPU” or “cloud: 8 vCPUs, 32 GB RAM, 1× T4”), I’ll lock in precise latency targets (ms), throughput (QPS), and batch-size recommendations tailored to that setup.",

    "[A1 Answer]: Great — to lock in precise latency (ms) and throughput (QPS) targets for the tabular plan, please provide your deployment details. If you don’t have exact specs, you can choose one of the common profiles below as a starting point and I’ll tailor from there.\n\nWhat I need (required fields)\n- Deployment type: Edge/on-device or Cloud (real-time) or Batch/high-throughput\n- CPU cores and RAM (and whether a GPU is available; include model if you have it)\n- GPU presence and type (e.g., 1× T4, V100) or none\n- Batching allowance: Yes or No (and typical batch size if Yes)\n- Optional: Task type (binary/multiclass/regression) to align the primary metric\n\nConcrete presets you can pick from (with explicit targets)\n\nPreset A — Edge / on-device (CPU-only)\n- Hardware example: 4-core CPU, 4 GB RAM, no GPU\n- Latency per inference: 20–40 ms\n- Throughput: 25–50 QPS (batch size 1)\n- Batch size: 1\n- Notes: minimal preprocessing; suitable for lightweight models (logistic regression, small GBM, small linear nets)\n\nPreset B — Cloud real-time (CPU)\n- Hardware example: 8 vCPUs, 16 GB RAM, no GPU\n- Latency per inference: 5–10 ms\n- Throughput: 200–1000 QPS (typical single-sample; batching 1–4 can help)\n- Batch size: 1 (or 2–4 if your serving supports small batches)\n- Notes: good baseline for fast scoring with moderate model complexity\n\nPreset C — Cloud real-time (GPU-accelerated)\n- Hardware example: 1× GPU (e.g., T4) + 32 GB RAM\n- Latency per inference: 1–5 ms\n- Throughput: 1000–5000 QPS (with small batches; batch size 4–32 depending on kernel)\n- Batch size: 4–32\n- Notes: best when you have a heavier model and need very low latency at high throughput\n\nPreset D — Batch/high-throughput\n- Hardware example: 32 vCPUs, 128 GB RAM (or equivalent GPU cluster)\n- Latency per batch: 200 ms per batch\n- Batch size: 32–128\n- Throughput: 160–640 QPS (approximate, scales with batch size)\n- Notes: ideal for nightly/periodic scoring pipelines or streaming with large batches\n\nHow to proceed\n- Pick one preset that matches your intended hardware, or share your exact specs (CPU cores, RAM, GPU, and whether batching is allowed).\n- Tell me your task type (binary/multiclass/regression) so I can align the primary metric.\n- If you have a preferred latency target or a minimum QPS requirement, include that and I’ll adjust the targets accordingly.\n\nOnce you provide the hardware profile (or pick A–D), I’ll lock in precise, concrete latency (ms) and throughput (QPS) targets for your tabular plan and produce a ready-to-use evaluation template with exact measurements, data-split guidance, baselines, and monitoring checks."

Ensure feature engineering is nested inside cross-validation to prevent leakage.\n- Employ proper resampling and model selection techniques: use cross-validation (preferably stratified for imbalanced data) and nested cross-validation for unbiased hyperparameter tuning and model comparison.\n- Choose metrics suited to the task and data: for classification, consider accuracy, precision/recall, F1, AUROC; for regression, RMSE, MAE, R^2; for ranking, AUC or NDCG. Include calibration metrics when probability estimates matter (e.g., Brier score).\n- Include baselines and statistical comparisons: compare against simple baselines (e.g., majority class, a simple model) and use appropriate statistical tests (e.g., paired t-test, Wilcoxon, McNemar) to determine if differences are meaningful.\n- Monitor generalization and learning dynamics: analyze learning curves to detect overfitting/underfitting and assess how performance scales with data size.\n- Calibration and reliability: ensure predicted probabilities reflect true frequencies; use calibration curves and metrics to assess reliability.\n- Robustness, fairness, and bias: evaluate performance across subgroups, check for fairness-related metrics, test robustness to noise or adversarial perturbations, and consider domain-specific constraints.\n- Uncertainty estimation: quantify predictive uncertainty (e.g., via ensembles, Bayesian methods) when decisions depend on confidence levels.\n- Interpretability and explainability: provide feature importance or explanations (e.g., SHAP/LIME) to build trust and satisfy regulatory or stakeholder needs.\n- Reproducibility and experiment tracking: fix random seeds, document data versions, splits, hyperparameters, and keep a record of experiments with versioned code and data.\n- Deployment readiness and monitoring: assess latency, memory, and throughput; plan for monitoring data drift, model decay, and retraining triggers in production.\n- Document and communicate results clearly: report methodology, data splits, metrics, baselines, statistical significance, and any limitations or caveats."

      "answer": "Great. To fill in concrete thresholds for the tabular plan, I need your deployment details. If you don’t have exact hardware, you can pick a common scenario and I’ll tailor from there. Below are three practical targets for typical tabular deployments, plus a ready-to-fill template you can use.\n\nThree common deployment scenarios (domain: tabular, latency/throughput as primary constraint)\n\n1) Edge / on-device, single-sample inference (no batching)\n- Latency per inference: 20 ms\n- Throughput (inferences per second): 50 QPS\n- Batch size: 1\n- Typical hardware: CPU-only, low-power device (e.g., Cortex-A family), ~2–4 GB RAM\n- Notes: Minimal feature preprocessing; GBM or lightweight linear models often used\n\n2) Cloud real-time inference, small to moderate load (batching not relied upon)\n- Latency per inference: 5 ms\n- Throughput: 200–1000 QPS (for single-sample processing; can scale with more cores)\n- Batch size: 1 (or small batches if you enable batching in serving)\n- Typical hardware: 2–8 vCPUs, 8–16 GB RAM (or equivalent), CPU- or GPU-accelerated serving\n- Notes: Suitable for real-time scoring with modest model complexity (logistic regression, gradient boosting, small DNNs)\n\n3) Batch-oriented or streaming high-throughput\n- Latency per batch: 200 ms (per batch)\n- Throughput: 32–128 samples per batch, yielding QPS ≈ (batch_size) / (latency_per_batch_seconds)\n- Example: batch_size 32, latency 0.20 s → QPS ≈ 160\n- Batch size: 32–128\n- Typical hardware: 8–32 vCPUs or equivalent GPU/TPU; memory scaled to hold batch data\n- Notes: Useful when you can tolerate a small end-to-end latency but need high aggregate throughput\n\nReady-to-fill template (domain-agnostic but tabular-ready)\n\n- Target latency per inference (ms): [____]\n- Target throughput (QPS): [____]\n- Batch size: [____]\n- Deployment hardware (example): [CPU model, number of cores, RAM in GB; GPU if applicable]\n- Expected usage pattern: [edge vs. cloud; real-time vs. batch]\n- Primary model family (roughly): [logistic regression / GBM / neural net / other]\n- Rationale: [brief note on why this target is chosen given constraints]\n\nHow to choose your numbers (quick guidance)\n- If you need real-time decisions on user actions (e.g., fraud scoring, risk scoring, live recommender): target low latency (5–20 ms) and higher QPS (100–1000+), usually on cloud with a strong CPU/GPU or optimized serving.\n- If the system can tolerate slight delays and you process in batches (e.g., nightly scoring, large-scale batch updates): you can set higher per-sample latency but higher aggregate throughput; compute QPS from batch_size / batch_latency_sec.\n- If you’re constrained to edge devices: expect higher per-sample latency (tens of ms to a few hundred ms) and lower QPS; plan for simpler models or aggressive feature engineering to stay within budget.\n\nWhat I need from you to finalize concrete thresholds\n- Which scenario best matches your deployment (edge/on-device, cloud real-time, or batch/high-throughput)? If you don’t know, provide:\n  - Target hardware (CPU model and available RAM, or indicate edge/cloud)\n  - Whether you plan to batch in serving (yes/no and typical batch size)\n  - Any latency or throughput requirements you must meet (in ms per inference and QPS)\n- Task type: binary classification, multiclass classification, or regression (so I can align the primary metric)\n- Any fairness/regulatory considerations to reflect in the plan (optional but helpful)\n\nIf you provide your hardware and whether batching is allowed, I’ll fill in exact numbers in your tabular plan and deliver a ready-to-use, domain-specific evaluation template with concrete thresholds, plus a brief rationale and measurement guidance.",
