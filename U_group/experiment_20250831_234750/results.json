    "seed_query": "I’m designing an evaluation framework to measure group consensus in a multi-agent decision system where each agent evaluates alternatives by multiple criteria, and I want the consensus metric to be non-compensatory (i.e., poor performance on any critical criterion cannot be traded off by high scores on others). Please propose concrete, implementable approaches and point out design choices that require clarification.\n\nContext and concrete parameters (can be adjusted if you recommend different scales):\n- Agents: N ≈ 100 heterogeneous agents.\n- Alternatives: M ≈ 20 candidate options.\n- Criteria: K ≈ 5 criteria. Each agent provides a score per alternative per criterion on a continuous [0,1] scale (or possibly ordinal — see clarification below).\n- Time: both static (one-shot) evaluation and a streaming setting where agents arrive/leave and update scores in real time.\n- Resources: moderate compute (single server, near-real-time aggregate updates required).\n\nWhat I need (for each proposed approach):\n1. Definition: a precise mathematical definition of a non-compensatory group-consensus metric that can be computed from the agents’ multi-criteria evaluations. Possible desiderata to consider:\n   - Non-compensatory behavior (no full trade-offs across criteria).\n   - Captures degree of agreement (not just unanimity): continuous index in [0,1].\n   - Handles agent weights and missing/partial evaluations.\n   - Interpretable and comparable across groups of different sizes.\n\n2. Candidate metrics: propose 2–4 different non-compensatory consensus metrics (e.g., conjunctive thresholding, lexicographic/ordinal aggregation, outranking-based consensus, distance-to-ideal under max/min norms, consensus as intersection of acceptable sets). For each:\n   - Formal formula and algorithm (pseudocode) to compute the metric from N × M × K scores.\n   - Complexity (time and memory).\n   - How to set any hyperparameters (thresholds, criterion importance, lexicographic ordering rules).\n   - How it behaves in edge cases (ties, identical agents, skewed scales).\n\n3. Aggregation and group decision linkage:\n   - Methods to go from the consensus metric to a group decision rule (e.g., accept alternative if consensus ≥ τ; choose alternative(s) maximizing consensus; produce a short-list).\n   - Trade-offs between maximizing consensus vs. average group utility.\n\n4. Robustness and validation:\n   - Null models / baselines and statistical tests to determine whether observed consensus is significant (e.g., permutation tests, bootstrap, comparisons to independent noise models).\n   - Sensitivity to noise, misreports, and missing values. Suggestions for robust variants (e.g., robust norms, majority-veto safeguards).\n\n5. Dynamic updates:\n   - Algorithms or incremental computations for maintaining the consensus metric efficiently when single agents or evaluations change (aim for sublinear updates if possible).\n   - Handling agent churn and variable N.\n\n6. Implementation guidance:\n   - Recommended data structures, vectorized operations, and any libraries/approaches that fit (e.g., use of matrix ops, approximate quantile summaries).\n   - Small synthetic experiment plan to compare metrics: how to generate agent populations with controlled agreement/disharmony; evaluation criteria to compare metrics (discriminative power, stability, runtime).\n\nUnclear aspects I expect you to ask me to clarify (but feel free to propose defaults and explain trade-offs):\n- Are criteria scores cardinal (continuous) or ordinal/ranked? Should the metric respect cardinal magnitudes or only orderings?\n- Do you require a single consensus index per group (across all alternatives) or per alternative?\n- Should non-compensatory mean strict conjunctive (all criteria must exceed thresholds), lexicographic priority, or simply “limited compensation” (e.g., Lp norms with small p)? Any preference?\n- Do agents have known weights or should all be equal? Any expected correlation structure among agents (clusters, coalitions)?\n- Is the goal to evaluate consensus about rankings, acceptability, or the final selection?\n- Real-time constraints: acceptable latency per update?\n\nDeliverable format I want: concise description of each metric with equations and pseudocode, complexity, recommended defaults for ambiguous choices, and a short experimental protocol (data generation + evaluation metrics) I can implement to compare them.\n\nIf you need further specifics, ask targeted clarifying questions before proposing algorithms.",

      "question": "Are the per-criterion scores cardinal (continuous on [0,1] where magnitudes matter) or strictly ordinal/ranked (only orderings matter)? In other words, should the consensus metric respect score magnitudes (distances) or only relative orderings/threshold crossings?",
      "answer": "Answer: treat the per-criterion scores as cardinal (continuous on [0,1]) — i.e., magnitudes matter.\n\nWhy I recommend cardinal:\n- You already specified a continuous [0,1] scale; using magnitudes gives more information (degree of acceptability, distance-to-threshold) and enables both threshold-based (conjunctive) and distance/norm-based non‑compensatory metrics.\n- Many non‑compensatory constructs (per‑criterion thresholds, max/min norms, Lp with small p, veto/majority veto) require cardinal values to behave usefully.\n- Cardinal scores still allow you to derive ordinal-only measures if needed (by ranking), but the reverse (recovering magnitudes from ranks) loses information.\n\nPractical implications & required choices if we proceed cardinal:\n- Calibration: because agents may use the [0,1] scale differently (lenient/harsh), decide whether to normalize per agent. Recommended defaults:\n  - If you expect consistent semantics of scale across agents, use raw scores.\n  - If agents differ in harshness/leniency, use a monotonic per-agent calibration: either percentile (rank → quantile) or affine rescaling to match a reference mean/std (e.g., map each agent's sample mean to 0.5 and SD to 0.15) or quantile normalization across agents.\n  - Keep calibrations monotonic to preserve non‑compensatory behavior that depends on order and thresholds.\n- Missing/partial evaluations: treat as \"unknown\" and compute consensus using only available evaluations; allow agent weights and normalize weights over present agents per alternative/criterion.\n- Thresholds: since values are absolute, thresholds (e.g., acceptability t = 0.6) will have clear meaning — I will propose sensible defaults (t ∈ [0.6,0.8]) but you can tune them to domain risk preferences.\n\nIf you instead require ordinal-only:\n- State that explicitly. Then I will produce order‑based non‑compensatory metrics (lexicographic order, outranking by majority pairwise comparisons, rank‑based intersections). To convert ordinal inputs into cardinal inputs you can map ranks to uniform quantiles or to scores using monotone functions, but this imposes assumptions.\n\nPlease confirm: use cardinal [0,1] scores (with optional per-agent monotonic calibration) as the basis for the proposed metrics. If you want strict ordinal methods instead, say so and I’ll produce the alternate set.",

      "question": "Do you require consensus measured per alternative (one consensus index for each of the M options), a single group-level consensus across all alternatives, or both (i.e., per-alternative indices plus an overall summary)?",
      "answer": "Answer: provide both — a per-alternative consensus index for each of the M options (this is the primary metric) plus a small set of group-level summary statistics derived from those per-alternative indices.\n\nRationale (short)\n- Decisions are about alternatives, so you need C_j for each alternative j to select/short-list.  \n- A single global index loses per-alternative structure (different alternatives can have very different consensus profiles).  \n- A compact global summary (mean/median/min/top-k/proportion-above-τ) is useful for monitoring overall group cohesion and for comparisons across groups/sessions.\n\nConcrete specification (ready to implement)\n\n1) Per-alternative consensus\n- Output: vector C ∈ [0,1]^M, where C_j is consensus for alternative j.\n- Computation: compute C_j with whichever non‑compensatory metric you choose (each metric below returns a value in [0,1] per alternative). Always normalize agent weights over the set of agents who provided at least one score for alternative j:\n  w_i^(j) = original_weight_i / sum_{i in A_j} original_weight_i\n  where A_j = agents who rated alternative j.\n- Missing values: a missing criterion value from agent i for alternative j is treated as “unknown”; metrics should either ignore that agent for that criterion (if metric aggregates per-criterion) or treat agent as partially contributing — implement per-metric rules (I will specify in the metric definitions).\n\n2) Group-level summary (report these by default)\n- mean_consensus = (1/M) * sum_{j=1..M} C_j\n- median_consensus = median_j(C_j)\n- min_consensus = min_j C_j (pessimistic; shows worst agreement)\n- top-k_consensus = (1/k) * sum of top-k C_j (k default = 3)\n- prop_above_tau = (1/M) * |{j : C_j ≥ τ}| with default τ = 0.7\n\nDefaults and comparability\n- Default τ = 0.7 (tune to domain); top-k = 3; report mean+median+min+prop_above_tau to capture central tendency, outliers, and success rate.  \n- Because C_j ∈ [0,1] by design and agent weights are normalized per-alternative, mean_consensus and prop_above_tau are comparable across different N and M (provided you use the same τ and weight conventions). If you use min_consensus or other min-based aggregators, be aware min can be sensitive to single-agent outliers — consider reporting both raw min and a robust min (e.g., 5th-percentile of C_j).\n\nOperational notes for streaming\n- Store per-alternative sufficient aggregates (depends on metric: sums, counts, quantile sketches, minima, etc.). This enables O(1) or O(K) incremental updates when a single agent’s scores change or an agent arrives/leaves.\n- Per-alternative indices and the above summary statistics are cheap to update incrementally; computing a single global index directly from raw data would be more expensive and less actionable.\n\nIf you want, I will now:\n- propose 3–4 concrete non-compensatory metrics (each producing per-alternative C_j) with formulas, pseudocode, complexity, defaults for hyperparameters, and streaming update rules; plus the experimental protocol you requested.",

Choose one (or give a ranked preference) from these concrete options so I can tailor formulas and update rules accordingly:\n- Strict conjunctive: an alternative is acceptable only if every criterion exceeds a fixed per‑criterion threshold (hard vetoes).\n- Lexicographic: criteria have a strict priority order; higher‑priority criteria dominate decisions unless tied.\n- Limited compensation / soft veto: low scores on any criterion strongly penalize overall score (e.g., small‑p norms, min/max aggregation, or per‑criterion veto thresholds that reduce but don't absolutely reject).\n- Outranking/veto (majority‑based): consensus defined by pairwise outranking relations with veto rules (non‑compensatory in social choice sense).\nIf you want multiple approaches, say which of the above you want me to include first (or whether to include all).",
      "answer": "Short answer (direct): prioritize \"limited compensation / soft veto\" as the primary meaning of non‑compensatory for your consensus metric. Include strict conjunctive and outranking/veto approaches as secondary alternatives, and treat lexicographic aggregation as optional (useful only if you can specify a stable priority ordering of criteria). I will produce full metric definitions and incremental update rules for the first three; include lexicographic as an extra if you confirm you need it.\n\nWhy this ranking (concise technical reasons)\n- Limited compensation / soft veto (primary)\n  - Best fit for cardinal [0,1] scores: supports continuous consensus ∈ [0,1] while enforcing strong penalties for low scores on any criterion.\n  - Flexible: can interpolate between strict non‑compensatory (min / hard veto) and more tolerant behavior (Lp norms with small p), so you can tune risk/strictness.\n  - Streaming friendly: metrics (Lp norms, soft-veto adjustments, per-criterion summaries) admit simple incremental updates and per-alternative sufficient statistics.\n  - Interpretable: tuning parameter p or veto thresholds gives a clear handle on non-compensation strength.\n- Strict conjunctive (secondary)\n  - Extremely interpretable and fully non‑compensatory (all criteria must pass thresholds).\n  - Sharp (binary) acceptability unless you convert to a continuous index (e.g., fraction of agents meeting thresholds); good as a baseline and for veto-dominant domains.\n  - Also very cheap to compute and easy to update incrementally.\n- Outranking/veto (secondary)\n  - Social-choice-compatible definition of non‑compensatory consensus (e.g., ELECTRE-style): handles majority comparisons and explicit veto rules across agents.\n  - More complex but valuable when you want pairwise dominance relations and collective veto behavior.\n  - A bit heavier to compute, but still implementable with per-alternative sufficient statistics.\n- Lexicographic (optional)\n  - Very strict form of non-compensation that requires a fixed, reliable priority ordering of criteria — often unrealistic unless domain experts provide that order.\n  - Not recommended as primary because it yields discontinuous behavior and is sensitive to ties/noise.\n\nRecommended default hyperparameter ranges (so I can use these in formulas/code)\n- Per-criterion acceptability threshold t_k (for conjunctive / veto): default 0.6–0.8; use 0.7 as default unless domain risk tolerance suggests otherwise.\n- Soft‑veto tuning via Lp norm: p ∈ (0,1] for non‑compensatory behaviour. Defaults:\n  - p = 1 (linear average) — fully compensatory (baseline).\n  - p = 0.5 — moderate non‑compensation (recommended default).\n  - p → 0 (or use min) — near-strict non‑compensation.\n- Veto threshold (outranking / hard veto): set per-criterion v_k so that score < v_k triggers major penalty; default v_k ∈ [0.2,0.4] below t_k or specify absolute (e.g., v_k = 0.4).\n- Concordance (outranking) threshold c (ELECTRE-style): default 0.6–0.75.\n- Aggregation of agent opinions: use normalized agent weights per-alternative (w_i^(j) = raw_w_i / sum_{i in A_j} raw_w_i).\n- Missing values: ignore missing per-criterion contributions and normalize weights over present entries.\n\nNext steps I’ll take if you confirm this prioritization\n- Provide 3 concrete implementable metrics (one per prioritized meaning): (A) Soft‑veto / Lp-based consensus (primary), (B) Conjunctive thresholding with continuous index, (C) Outranking with veto (ELECTRE-style consensus score). For each I’ll give precise formulas, pseudocode, streaming/incremental update rules, complexity, hyperparameter advice, edge‑case behavior, robust variants, and an experimental protocol.\n- Optionally add a lexicographic metric if you want it included.\n\nQuestion for you (one required confirmation)\n- Confirm: proceed with the three metrics above (soft‑veto/Lp primary, conjunctive, outranking), and omit lexicographic unless requested?

      "answer": "Answer: support both, with a clear default and precise handling rules.\n\nShort answer / default\n- Default: treat all agents as equal unless you (the system) supply explicit per-agent weights. So use raw weight r_i = 1 for every agent i by default.\n- If you have external weights (trust, expertise) supply nonnegative raw weights r_i ≥ 0. These will be used after normalization per-alternative (see below).\n- Always normalize weights over the agents who actually contributed to the alternative (so results are comparable across varying N and agent churn).\n\nPrecise specification and formulas\n\n1) Raw vs. normalized weights\n- Input: for each agent i a raw weight r_i ∈ [0, ∞). If none provided, set r_i = 1.\n- For alternative j let A_j = {i : agent i provided at least one score for alternative j}.\n- Per-alternative normalized weight:\n  w_i^(j) = r_i / (∑_{i'∈A_j} r_{i'})  for i ∈ A_j.\n  (Agents not in A_j have w_i^(j) = 0.)\n- Use w_i^(j) when computing any weighted aggregate (mean, concordance, Lp etc.). This guarantees ∑_{i} w_i^(j) = 1 and comparability across alternatives and group sizes.\n\n2) Handling missing/partial evaluations\n- If an agent i rated alternative j but omitted some criteria, treat their contribution only on criteria they provided.\n- For per-criterion aggregates (e.g., per-criterion means) normalize weights across agents who provided that criterion:\n  For criterion k on alternative j, A_{j,k} = {i : score s_{i,j,k} observed}.\n  w_i^{(j,k)} = r_i / (∑_{i'∈A_{j,k}} r_{i'}) for i ∈ A_{j,k}.\n- When computing an aggregate that combines criteria (e.g., per-agent Lp of their K scores), compute the per-agent score using the observed criteria only (or impute), but still use w_i^(j) normalized over agents who rated the alternative.\n\n3) Stability / anti-domination safeguards (recommended)\n- Cap maximum normalized weight to prevent a single agent dominating consensus (recommended default cap α_max = 0.20). Implemented as:\n  - Compute preliminary w_i^(j).\n  - If max_i w_i^(j) > α_max, shrink weights via clipping + renormalization:\n    w_i' = min(w_i^(j), α_max); then renormalize over A_j.\n- Alternative: use temperature-controlled softmax on log-weights to damp extremes:\n  w_i^(j) ∝ exp( log(r_i) / T ) with T ≥ 0.1 (T=1 default). Lower T → concentrates mass more; higher T → uniform.\n- Add small floor ε to denominators (ε = 1e-9) to avoid divide-by-zero in degenerate cases (no raters).\n\n4) Learning / estimating weights (optional advanced)\n- If no external r_i but you want reliability-based weights, recommended simple, robust online estimator:\n  - Maintain a running reliability score R_i (e.g., inverse MSE to consensus or to historical ground truth).\n  - One practical formula (streaming, exponential smoothing):\n    Let e_{i,t} = loss of agent i at time t (e.g., MSE between i’s per-alternative composite score and current ensemble composite). Update:\n      R_i ← (1−β) R_i + β * f(e_{i,t})\n    with f(e) = 1 / (1 + e) or f(e) = exp(−λ e). Use β ∈ [0.01,0.1] for stability and λ controlling sensitivity.\n  - Convert to raw weight r_i = (R_i + δ) where δ is a prior (e.g., δ = 0.1) to avoid zeroing inexperienced agents.\n  - Regularize (e.g., shrink towards uniform): r_i ← (1−γ) r_i + γ*mean_r across agents, γ ∈ [0.01,0.1].\n- If ground-truth labels are occasionally available, consider Bayesian updating of per-agent accuracy (Beta-Bernoulli for binary judgments or Gaussian models for continuous scores).\n\n5) Per-criterion / per-alternative weight extensions\n- If you need agent reliability that varies by criterion, allow r_{i,k} (raw weight of agent i for criterion k). Normalize per (j,k) as in §2:\n  w_{i}^{(j,k)} = r_{i,k} / ∑_{i'∈A_{j,k}} r_{i',k}.\n- Keep default behavior simple: only per-agent weights r_i unless you explicitly provide per-criterion weights.\n\n6) Complexity and streaming notes\n- Normalizing weights per alternative requires maintaining S_j = ∑_{i∈A_j} r_i. On agent add/remove or weight change, update S_j in O(1) and recompute affected normalized weights by O(|A_j|) if you need all normalized weights, but typically you only need w_i^(j) for changed agents or to compute weighted aggregates incrementally:\n  - Maintain per-alternative weighted sums (e.g., ∑ w_i^(j) * score_i) using raw r_i and denominator S_j; update aggregates in O(K) when a single agent change occurs.\n- Storage: store raw r_i per agent (size O(N)); per-alternative denominators S_j (size O(M)). For per-criterion weights, store r_{i,k} (size O(NK)).\n\n7) Recommended defaults (concise)\n- If no external weights: r_i = 1 for all i.\n- If external weights: accept r_i ≥ 0; normalize per alternative as above.\n- Safeguard: cap max normalized weight α_max = 0.20 (tunable); floor ε = 1e-9.\n- If you want automatic weight estimation: use exponential smoothing with β = 0.05, f(e)=exp(−λ e) with λ = 5 as a starting point, and a small prior δ = 0.1.\n\nShort rationale\n- Equal default keeps metrics simple, interpretable, and comparable across groups.\n- Allowing external weights supports domains with known expertise/trust.\n- Normalizing per-alternative ensures fair comparison across alternatives and robustness to agent churn.\n- Capping and smoothing prevent domination by a single agent or noisy weight estimates.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Provide pseudocode snippets showing exactly how to incorporate r_i into each of the proposed consensus metrics (soft-veto Lp, conjunctive, outranking), including streaming update routines.",

      "answer": "Short answer / recommended defaults (given your single-server, moderate‑compute constraint and \"near‑real‑time\" requirement):\n\n- Target latency per single update (end-to-end observable effect on aggregates): ≤200 ms (aim for ≤100 ms if you want snappier interactivity).\n- Typical sustained update arrival rate to support: 100 updates/sec.\n- Peak burst rate to support without data loss (with batching): 500 updates/sec.\n- Allowable staleness / eventual consistency: yes — batching with max staleness = 1 s is acceptable for most monitoring/use cases; if you need stricter semantics for a decision commit, require synchronous update and lower staleness (≤100 ms).\n- If you need true hard real‑time guarantees (<10 ms) or >1k updates/sec sustained, you must scale beyond a single moderate server (sharding, partitioning, or more powerful hardware).\n\nRationale and concrete implications\n\n1) Why these numbers\n- N ≈ 100, M ≈ 20, K ≈ 5 → per‑update work is small (typically O(K) or O(K + per‑criterion constant work)). Thus a single server can handle moderately high rates if you use incremental (constant time) updates and in‑memory data.\n- Latency budget of 100–200 ms gives room for (a) network I/O, (b) thread scheduling, (c) atomic updates to in‑memory aggregates, and (d) occasional small recomputations (e.g., recomputing a per‑alternative consensus that needs only O(1) maintained aggregates).\n- Allowing up to 1 s staleness (eventual consistency) enables efficient batching (e.g., 100–200 ms minibatches) to amortize overhead and handle bursts up to 500/sec on a single server.\n\n2) Operating modes and what they require\n- Interactive mode (UI shows nearly immediate effect): aim ≤100 ms per update. Use per‑update incremental updates (no heavy recompute), lock‑free or fine‑grained locks per alternative, in‑memory arrays, atomic adds for sums, and immediate recompute of C_j (O(K)) on each update.\n- Near‑real‑time monitoring (dashboard acceptable with small delay): latency ≤200–500 ms with mini‑batching every 100–300 ms. This increases throughput (handle bursts) and reduces contention.\n- High‑throughput logging/analytics (not strict immediacy): batch updates up to 1 s and use eventual consistency. Can merge updates in bulk and recompute heavier aggregates (quantiles, robust norms) on a schedule.\n\n3) Concrete update‑rate → design tradeoffs\n- ≤100/sec sustained, ≤200 ms latency: implement simple incremental aggregates (per-agent contributions, per-criterion weighted sums, per-alternative minima/maxima) and recompute metric in O(K) per changed agent/alternative. No batching needed.\n- 100–500/sec bursts: use short batching (window 50–200 ms). Aggregate updates per alternative inside the window and apply a single atomic update to the maintained sufficient statistics per alternative.\n- >500–1000/sec sustained: require horizontal scaling (partition alternatives across worker threads/processes) or stronger hardware.\n\n4) Consistency semantics & suggested defaults\n- Default: eventual consistency with bounded staleness T_stale = 1 s and batch window W = 100–200 ms. This preserves near‑real‑time dashboarding and simplifies throughput.\n- If you require decision‑time consistency (e.g., an accept/reject action must reflect the most recent scores), perform a synchronous recompute for the affected alternative at decision time: use latest values in memory and lock the alternative briefly while computing (O(K) cost).\n- For streaming aggregates that must be deterministic across replicas, use a deterministic merge function (commutative/associative aggregates like sums, counts, minima) so batching order doesn't change result.\n\n5) Practical engineering recommendations to meet targets\n- Keep per‑alternative sufficient statistics in-memory: weighted sums per criterion, weighted Lp accumulator (or store ∑ w * s^p), per‑criterion minima/maxima, counters. This allows O(K) updates.\n- Use fine‑grained concurrency: one mutex/lock per alternative (M ≈ 20 → trivial) or lock‑free atomics for each aggregate. With M small you can partition by alternative cheaply.\n- For quantiles or percentile‑based calibrations, use streaming quantile sketches (t-digest or KLL) — these accept batched updates and are memory/time efficient.\n- For capped agent weights or clipping, maintain per-alternative denominator S_j; updating r_i affects only alternatives the agent rated (store agent→alternatives map).\n- Use batching for bursts: server accumulates incoming updates up to W ms and applies compressed updates per alternative.\n\n6) If you want stricter numbers (answer now)\n- If you require guaranteed per-update latency <50 ms and <10 ms, or sustained >1k updates/sec, tell me which target you need and I’ll provide more aggressive micro‑optimizations and scaling recommendations (threading, sharding, memory layout).\n\nConfirm or adjust\n- If these targets (≤200 ms latency, 100/sec typical, 500/sec peak, staleness ≤1 s) match your operational tolerance I’ll use them as defaults in the algorithm specs, complexity targets, and streaming update pseudocode. If you need lower latency or higher throughput, say which and I’ll adapt the implementation guidance and data structures.",

      "question": "Do you want per-agent score calibration to correct for leniency/harshness before computing consensus — and if so, which method should I assume as default: (A) no calibration (raw [0,1] scores), (B) affine rescaling per agent to match a reference mean/SD, or (C) monotonic quantile mapping (percentile/quantile normalization)? If you prefer another method, specify that.",
      "answer": "Answer: use (B) affine rescaling per agent to match a reference mean and SD as the default, with a clear fallback rule and an option to switch to (C) monotonic quantile mapping when you detect strong non‑linear usage of the scale. Below are the concrete specs, formulas, streaming updates, defaults and tradeoffs so you can implement reliably.\n\n1) Why default = (B) affine rescaling\n- Lightweight, preserves cardinal magnitudes and distances (important because you treat scores as cardinal).\n- Easy to compute and incremental (Welford or exponential smoothing for mean/variance).\n- Interpretable: you map each agent to the same reference mean/SD (domain semantics e.g., “0.5 is neutral/acceptable”).\n- Works well when agents differ mostly by leniency/harshness (location + scale). If agents distort the shape (clipping, nonlinearity) use (C).\n\n2) Exact affine calibration formula (per agent i)\n- Let s_{i,j,k} be observed score by agent i on alternative j, criterion k in [0,1].\n- Compute agent sample mean μ_i and sample std σ_i (over that agent’s observed scores; see streaming below).\n- Choose reference target mean μ* and target std σ*. Recommended defaults:\n  - μ* = 0.5\n  - σ* = 0.15 (so most mass stays in [0,1]; adjust to domain)\n- Apply affine map:\n  a_i = σ* / max(σ_i_shrunk, σ_min)\n  b_i = μ* − a_i * μ_i_shrunk\n  s'_{i,j,k} = clamp(a_i * s_{i,j,k} + b_i, 0, 1)\n- clamp(x,0,1) = min(max(x,0),1).\n\n3) Shrinkage / small-sample regularization (important)\n- Avoid unstable transforms for low n_i (number of scores by agent). Use Bayesian/shrinkage estimates:\n  μ_i_shrunk = (n_i * μ_i + τ * μ_global) / (n_i + τ)\n  σ_i_shrunk^2 = (n_i * σ_i^2 + τ * σ_global^2) / (n_i + τ)\n  where μ_global, σ_global are running global mean/std across all agents; τ is pseudocount (strength).\n- Recommended defaults:\n  - τ = 20 (requires ~20 observations to trust agent stats)\n  - σ_min = 0.05 (avoid division by near-zero)\n- Alternative exponential smoothing (streaming): maintain EWMA mean/variance with α ≈ 0.01–0.05 and map using current EWMA values; combine shrinkage toward global via convex mix if desired.\n\n4) Streaming / incremental estimation\n- Maintain per-agent sufficient stats:\n  - count n_i\n  - running mean μ_i (Welford or EWMA)\n  - running M2 for variance (Welford) OR EWMA variance.\n- Welford (batch-correct, exact):\n  On new x:\n    n ← n + 1\n    delta ← x − μ\n    μ ← μ + delta / n\n    M2 ← M2 + delta * (x − μ)\n    σ = sqrt( M2 / (n−1) ) for n>1\n- For heavy streaming with concept drift, use EWMA:\n    μ ← (1−α) μ + α x\n    var ← (1−α) var + α (x−μ)^2\n- Maintain global μ_global, σ_global similarly.\n- Recompute a_i,b_i whenever μ_i_shrunk or σ_i_shrunk changes enough (or on each update). Per-agent recalculation is O(1); applying mapping to an agent’s scores in aggregate uses stored transformed contributions (see streaming updates for consensus metrics).\n\n5) Implementation choices & safety\n- Min samples before activating calibration: min_count = 20. Before that, either (i) use no calibration (identity), or (ii) apply shrinkage heavily (τ large).\n- Cap max adjustment (avoid extreme slope): cap a_i ∈ [a_min, a_max], e.g., a_min = 0.5, a_max = 2.0.\n- After affine mapping, always clamp to [0,1].\n- Store both raw and calibrated scores so you can inspect effect and revert if necessary.\n\n6) When to prefer monotonic quantile mapping (C)\n- Use (C) if you detect:\n  - Strong nonlinearity (agents use only ends of scale, or many identical repeated values).\n  - Heavy clipping/bunching (lots of 0/1 or repeated discrete levels).\n  - You need to preserve each agent’s internal ranking but want to align distributions precisely.\n- Implementation note for (C): use t-digest or KLL sketches to estimate quantile functions per agent and global quantile function; transform s → Q_global( F_i(s) ). Streaming-friendly libraries exist (t-digest, KLL). More complex and destroys absolute distances (but preserves ordering within an agent).\n\n7) Diagnostics & automatic switch\n- Compute calibration residual diagnostics per agent:\n  - KL or Wasserstein distance between agent empirical distribution and global distribution (cheap via quantile sketch).\n  - If distance < threshold (default 0.05 L1 quantile distance) → affine is fine.\n  - If distance large and monotonic rank-preserving alignment would reduce distance significantly → consider switching to quantile mapping for that agent.\n- Log histograms / quantiles pre/post calibration for monitoring.\n\n8) Short summary of recommended defaults (copy‑paste ready)\n- Default: affine rescaling (B).\n- Reference: μ* = 0.5, σ* = 0.15.\n- Shrinkage pseudocount τ = 20, min_count = 20.\n- σ_min = 0.05, a ∈ [0.5, 2.0].\n- Streaming estimator: Welford for accuracy, or EWMA with α = 0.02 if you expect drift.\n- Optionally switch to monotonic quantile mapping (C) when distributional distance > 0.1 (tune for domain).\n\n9) Effect on consensus metrics\n- Affine calibration preserves linear relationships and distances so downstream Lp-based soft-veto metrics, conjunctive thresholds, veto rules, and outranking remain meaningful and comparable across agents.\n- Use calibrated scores consistently when computing per-agent composites or per-criterion aggregates; keep raw scores saved for audit.\n\nIf you want, I can provide:\n- Ready-to-run pseudocode for (a) per-agent Welford streaming stats + affine mapping, (b) a t-digest KLL-based quantile calibration alternative, and (c) the integration points where calibration is applied before each of the proposed consensus metrics.",

      "question": "Do agents typically rate all M alternatives (dense N×M×K data), or is the rating matrix sparse (each agent rates only a subset of alternatives)? Also: will alternatives themselves be added/removed dynamically in the streaming setting?",
      "answer": "Short answer (direct): assume a sparse rating matrix — each agent typically rates only a subset of the M alternatives — and yes, alternatives may be added and removed dynamically. I’ll give precise, implementable specifications and defaults you can use in the framework.\n\nConcrete assumptions / defaults you can change\n- Sparsity: average alternatives rated per agent q (default q = 10 of M = 20). So density ≈ q / M = 0.5 by default; framework works for much sparser cases (q down to 1–5).\n- Minimum raters required to report a stable consensus for an alternative: min_raters = 5 (tunable).\n- New-alternative warm-up: require W = min_raters ratings or a time window T_warm (e.g., 1 minute or 100 updates) before treating C_j as stable; otherwise report C_j with high uncertainty flag.\n- Missing per-criterion values: treat as “not rated” for that (j,k) and compute per-criterion aggregates only over observed entries.\n\nWhy this choice (brief)\n- In realistic multi-agent systems not every agent will evaluate all M options; a sparse design is more flexible and efficient.\n- The consensus definitions you requested (weighted aggregates, Lp/soft‑veto, conjunctive thresholds, outranking) all operate naturally on per-alternative aggregates computed from the subset of raters who provided scores.\n\nData-model & bookkeeping you must maintain\n- Primary sparse storage:\n  - agent→(alternative → K-vector of (possibly partial) scores): per-agent rating map (hash/dict), or a CSR sparse matrix.\n  - alternative→(agent → K-vector): inverted index for fast per-alternative aggregation (hash/dict).\n- Per-alternative sufficient statistics (for alternative j):\n  - S_j = ∑_{i∈A_j} r_i (raw weight denominator).\n  - For each criterion k: sum_{j,k} = ∑_{i∈A_{j,k}} r_i * s_{i,j,k}; count_{j,k} = |A_{j,k}|.\n  - For Lp-based metrics: maintain power sums P_{j,k}^{(p)} = ∑_{i∈A_{j}} r_i * (s_{i,j,k})^p (or per-agent composite powers as needed).\n  - Per-criterion min_{j,k} and other extrema if used by metrics.\n  - Optional: quantile sketch per (j,k) (t-digest / KLL) if you need percentiles or calibration.\n- Per-agent stats (for calibration & weight learning):\n  - n_i, μ_i, σ_i (Welford / EWMA) and list of alternatives rated (for efficient removal on churn).\n\nUpdate semantics (agent add/remove / score change)\n- Agent i adds rating for alternative j:\n  - Insert into agent→alt map and alt→agent map.\n  - Update S_j += r_i; for each observed criterion k: sum_{j,k} += r_i * s_{i,j,k}; count_{j,k} += 1; P_{j,k}^{(p)} += r_i * s^p.\n  - Recompute C_j from updated sufficient stats in O(K) time.\n- Agent i removes rating for j (or leaves system):\n  - Remove mapping, do S_j -= r_i and subtract per-criterion contributions; recompute C_j in O(K).\n  - If S_j becomes 0, treat alternative as unrated and C_j = undefined/NaN.\n- Agent i updates a score on (j,k):\n  - Compute delta and apply to sums and power sums; recompute C_j in O(K).\n- Alternative addition:\n  - Initialize empty S_j = 0 and empty per-criterion aggregates; treat as warm-up until min_raters reached.\n- Alternative removal:\n  - Delete per-alternative aggregates and free inverted index entries.\n\nComplexity and memory (formulas)\n- Storage:\n  - Sparse ratings: O(total_ratings * K) where total_ratings = ∑_i |rated_alternatives_i|. For default N=100, q=10 → total_ratings=1000, so memory trivial.\n  - Per-alternative aggregates: O(M * K).\n  - Per-agent stats: O(N).\n- Update time per single rating addition/change: O(K) to update sufficient stats and recompute C_j.\n  - If you maintain per-criterion quantile sketches, update sketches in amortized O(log n) or O(1) depending on library.\n- If you recompute a global summary across all M alternatives after each update: O(1) to update the few summary scalars using delta to C_j; otherwise O(M) if recomputing from scratch.\n\nImplications for the consensus metrics you asked for\n- Per-alternative normalization: use w_i^(j) = r_i / ∑_{i∈A_j} r_i (only over agents who rated j). This ensures comparability across different numbers of raters.\n- Sparse rating caveat for pairwise outranking metrics: if two alternatives a and b have disjoint rater sets, pairwise comparisons must either:\n  - base outranking on only common raters A_{a} ∩ A_{b}, or\n  - impute missing scores, or\n  - use weighted indirect comparisons (less preferred).\n  Recommendation: prefer common-rater comparisons and report coverage (|A_a ∩ A_b|) used for each pairwise result. If coverage is low, mark outranking as uncertain.\n- For conjunctive thresholds: compute fraction (or weighted fraction) of raters who meet per-criterion thresholds. With sparsity, denominator per (j,k) is |A_{j,k}| (raters who provided that criterion). Require min_raters to reduce volatility.\n- For Lp/soft-veto metrics: power sums P_{j,k}^{(p)} computed from present raters suffice; missing criteria are simply absent from those sums.\n\nRobustness & small-sample handling (sparse-specific)\n- Don’t report raw C_j until at least min_raters; before that return a prior or Bayesian posterior with high uncertainty.\n- Provide confidence intervals: bootstrap over the observed rater set A_j (resample with replacement) to estimate variance of C_j; with small |A_j| use parametric priors.\n- For calibration and weight estimation, use shrinkage toward global stats (τ = 20): important when agents rate very few alternatives.\n\nConcurrency & streaming recommendations\n- With M small (≈20) simplest approach: one lock per alternative for safe concurrent updates. Each update touches only one alternative’s aggregates → low contention.\n- If M large or q large: partition alternatives across workers.\n- Use batching W_ms (default 100–200 ms) to group updates and apply per-alternative delta updates in bulk if throughput bursts occur.\n\nDiagnostics to surface for sparse data\n- Per-alternative: |A_j|, per-criterion counts |A_{j,k}|, coverage fraction |A_j|/N, and confidence interval for C_j.\n- For pairwise/outranking reporting: coverage |A_a ∩ A_b| and an uncertainty flag if coverage < threshold (e.g., < min_raters).\n\nEdge cases & design choices you may want to revisit\n- Extremely sparse regime (many alternatives, each rated by very few agents): increase min_raters or require active sampling to obtain more ratings for important alternatives.\n- Disjoint rater groups across alternatives: global summaries may be misleading — consider grouping agents or stratified summaries by agent clusters.\n- If alternatives are frequently added/removed, tune warm-up thresholds for acceptable latency vs. statistical reliability.\n\nShort checklist you can implement now\n- Treat rating matrix as sparse; implement agent→alts and alt→agents maps.\n- Maintain per-alternative aggregates S_j, sum_{j,k}, count_{j,k}, P_{j,k}^{(p)}.\n- Update aggregates and recompute C_j in O(K) per rating change.\n- Require min_raters before reporting stable C_j; provide uncertainty intervals using bootstrap or analytic variance where available.\n- For pairwise/outranking methods only compare on common raters and report coverage.\n\nIf you want, I can now produce:\n- Exact pseudocode for the sparse storage + incremental updates (add/change/remove rating, add/remove alternative).\n- Integration of these routines into each proposed consensus metric (soft-veto Lp, conjunctive threshold, outranking) including how to handle disjoint raters in outranking.",

    "[A1] I’m designing an evaluation framework to measure group consensus in a multi-agent decision system where each agent evaluates alternatives by multiple criteria, and I want the consensus metric to be non-compensatory (i.e., poor performance on any critical criterion cannot be traded off by high scores on others). Please propose concrete, implementable approaches and point out design choices that require clarification.\n\nContext and concrete parameters (can be adjusted if you recommend different scales):\n- Agents: N ≈ 100 heterogeneous agents.\n- Alternatives: M ≈ 20 candidate options.\n- Criteria: K ≈ 5 criteria. Each agent provides a score per alternative per criterion on a continuous [0,1] scale (or possibly ordinal — see clarification below).\n- Time: both static (one-shot) evaluation and a streaming setting where agents arrive/leave and update scores in real time.\n- Resources: moderate compute (single server, near-real-time aggregate updates required).\n\nWhat I need (for each proposed approach):\n1. Definition: a precise mathematical definition of a non-compensatory group-consensus metric that can be computed from the agents’ multi-criteria evaluations. Possible desiderata to consider:\n   - Non-compensatory behavior (no full trade-offs across criteria).\n   - Captures degree of agreement (not just unanimity): continuous index in [0,1].\n   - Handles agent weights and missing/partial evaluations.\n   - Interpretable and comparable across groups of different sizes.\n\n2. Candidate metrics: propose 2–4 different non-compensatory consensus metrics (e.g., conjunctive thresholding, lexicographic/ordinal aggregation, outranking-based consensus, distance-to-ideal under max/min norms, consensus as intersection of acceptable sets). For each:\n   - Formal formula and algorithm (pseudocode) to compute the metric from N × M × K scores.\n   - Complexity (time and memory).\n   - How to set any hyperparameters (thresholds, criterion importance, lexicographic ordering rules).\n   - How it behaves in edge cases (ties, identical agents, skewed scales).\n\n3. Aggregation and group decision linkage:\n   - Methods to go from the consensus metric to a group decision rule (e.g., accept alternative if consensus ≥ τ; choose alternative(s) maximizing consensus; produce a short-list).\n   - Trade-offs between maximizing consensus vs. average group utility.\n\n4. Robustness and validation:\n   - Null models / baselines and statistical tests to determine whether observed consensus is significant (e.g., permutation tests, bootstrap, comparisons to independent noise models).\n   - Sensitivity to noise, misreports, and missing values. Suggestions for robust variants (e.g., robust norms, majority-veto safeguards).\n\n5. Dynamic updates:\n   - Algorithms or incremental computations for maintaining the consensus metric efficiently when single agents or evaluations change (aim for sublinear updates if possible).\n   - Handling agent churn and variable N.\n\n6. Implementation guidance:\n   - Recommended data structures, vectorized operations, and any libraries/approaches that fit (e.g., use of matrix ops, approximate quantile summaries).\n   - Small synthetic experiment plan to compare metrics: how to generate agent populations with controlled agreement/disharmony; evaluation criteria to compare metrics (discriminative power, stability, runtime).\n\nUnclear aspects I expect you to ask me to clarify (but feel free to propose defaults and explain trade-offs):\n- Are criteria scores cardinal (continuous) or ordinal/ranked? Should the metric respect cardinal magnitudes or only orderings?\n- Do you require a single consensus index per group (across all alternatives) or per alternative?\n- Should non-compensatory mean strict conjunctive (all criteria must exceed thresholds), lexicographic priority, or simply “limited compensation” (e.g., Lp norms with small p)? Any preference?\n- Do agents have known weights or should all be equal? Any expected correlation structure among agents (clusters, coalitions)?\n- Is the goal to evaluate consensus about rankings, acceptability, or the final selection?\n- Real-time constraints: acceptable latency per update?\n\nDeliverable format I want: concise description of each metric with equations and pseudocode, complexity, recommended defaults for ambiguous choices, and a short experimental protocol (data generation + evaluation metrics) I can implement to compare them.\n\nIf you need further specifics, ask targeted clarifying questions before proposing algorithms.",
    "[A2 Question]: Are the per-criterion scores cardinal (continuous on [0,1] where magnitudes matter) or strictly ordinal/ranked (only orderings matter)? In other words, should the consensus metric respect score magnitudes (distances) or only relative orderings/threshold crossings?",
    "[A1 Answer]: Answer: treat the per-criterion scores as cardinal (continuous on [0,1]) — i.e., magnitudes matter.\n\nWhy I recommend cardinal:\n- You already specified a continuous [0,1] scale; using magnitudes gives more information (degree of acceptability, distance-to-threshold) and enables both threshold-based (conjunctive) and distance/norm-based non‑compensatory metrics.\n- Many non‑compensatory constructs (per‑criterion thresholds, max/min norms, Lp with small p, veto/majority veto) require cardinal values to behave usefully.\n- Cardinal scores still allow you to derive ordinal-only measures if needed (by ranking), but the reverse (recovering magnitudes from ranks) loses information.\n\nPractical implications & required choices if we proceed cardinal:\n- Calibration: because agents may use the [0,1] scale differently (lenient/harsh), decide whether to normalize per agent. Recommended defaults:\n  - If you expect consistent semantics of scale across agents, use raw scores.\n  - If agents differ in harshness/leniency, use a monotonic per-agent calibration: either percentile (rank → quantile) or affine rescaling to match a reference mean/std (e.g., map each agent's sample mean to 0.5 and SD to 0.15) or quantile normalization across agents.\n  - Keep calibrations monotonic to preserve non‑compensatory behavior that depends on order and thresholds.\n- Missing/partial evaluations: treat as \"unknown\" and compute consensus using only available evaluations; allow agent weights and normalize weights over present agents per alternative/criterion.\n- Thresholds: since values are absolute, thresholds (e.g., acceptability t = 0.6) will have clear meaning — I will propose sensible defaults (t ∈ [0.6,0.8]) but you can tune them to domain risk preferences.\n\nIf you instead require ordinal-only:\n- State that explicitly. Then I will produce order‑based non‑compensatory metrics (lexicographic order, outranking by majority pairwise comparisons, rank‑based intersections). To convert ordinal inputs into cardinal inputs you can map ranks to uniform quantiles or to scores using monotone functions, but this imposes assumptions.\n\nPlease confirm: use cardinal [0,1] scores (with optional per-agent monotonic calibration) as the basis for the proposed metrics. If you want strict ordinal methods instead, say so and I’ll produce the alternate set.",
    "[A3 Question]: Do you require consensus measured per alternative (one consensus index for each of the M options), a single group-level consensus across all alternatives, or both (i.e., per-alternative indices plus an overall summary)?",
    "[A1 Answer]: Answer: provide both — a per-alternative consensus index for each of the M options (this is the primary metric) plus a small set of group-level summary statistics derived from those per-alternative indices.\n\nRationale (short)\n- Decisions are about alternatives, so you need C_j for each alternative j to select/short-list.  \n- A single global index loses per-alternative structure (different alternatives can have very different consensus profiles).  \n- A compact global summary (mean/median/min/top-k/proportion-above-τ) is useful for monitoring overall group cohesion and for comparisons across groups/sessions.\n\nConcrete specification (ready to implement)\n\n1) Per-alternative consensus\n- Output: vector C ∈ [0,1]^M, where C_j is consensus for alternative j.\n- Computation: compute C_j with whichever non‑compensatory metric you choose (each metric below returns a value in [0,1] per alternative). Always normalize agent weights over the set of agents who provided at least one score for alternative j:\n  w_i^(j) = original_weight_i / sum_{i in A_j} original_weight_i\n  where A_j = agents who rated alternative j.\n- Missing values: a missing criterion value from agent i for alternative j is treated as “unknown”; metrics should either ignore that agent for that criterion (if metric aggregates per-criterion) or treat agent as partially contributing — implement per-metric rules (I will specify in the metric definitions).\n\n2) Group-level summary (report these by default)\n- mean_consensus = (1/M) * sum_{j=1..M} C_j\n- median_consensus = median_j(C_j)\n- min_consensus = min_j C_j (pessimistic; shows worst agreement)\n- top-k_consensus = (1/k) * sum of top-k C_j (k default = 3)\n- prop_above_tau = (1/M) * |{j : C_j ≥ τ}| with default τ = 0.7\n\nDefaults and comparability\n- Default τ = 0.7 (tune to domain); top-k = 3; report mean+median+min+prop_above_tau to capture central tendency, outliers, and success rate.  \n- Because C_j ∈ [0,1] by design and agent weights are normalized per-alternative, mean_consensus and prop_above_tau are comparable across different N and M (provided you use the same τ and weight conventions). If you use min_consensus or other min-based aggregators, be aware min can be sensitive to single-agent outliers — consider reporting both raw min and a robust min (e.g., 5th-percentile of C_j).\n\nOperational notes for streaming\n- Store per-alternative sufficient aggregates (depends on metric: sums, counts, quantile sketches, minima, etc.). This enables O(1) or O(K) incremental updates when a single agent’s scores change or an agent arrives/leaves.\n- Per-alternative indices and the above summary statistics are cheap to update incrementally; computing a single global index directly from raw data would be more expensive and less actionable.\n\nIf you want, I will now:\n- propose 3–4 concrete non-compensatory metrics (each producing per-alternative C_j) with formulas, pseudocode, complexity, defaults for hyperparameters, and streaming update rules; plus the experimental protocol you requested.",
    "[A4 Question]: Which precise meaning of \"non‑compensatory\" should I prioritize for the consensus metric? Choose one (or give a ranked preference) from these concrete options so I can tailor formulas and update rules accordingly:\n- Strict conjunctive: an alternative is acceptable only if every criterion exceeds a fixed per‑criterion threshold (hard vetoes).\n- Lexicographic: criteria have a strict priority order; higher‑priority criteria dominate decisions unless tied.\n- Limited compensation / soft veto: low scores on any criterion strongly penalize overall score (e.g., small‑p norms, min/max aggregation, or per‑criterion veto thresholds that reduce but don't absolutely reject).\n- Outranking/veto (majority‑based): consensus defined by pairwise outranking relations with veto rules (non‑compensatory in social choice sense).\nIf you want multiple approaches, say which of the above you want me to include first (or whether to include all).",
    "[A1 Answer]: Short answer (direct): prioritize \"limited compensation / soft veto\" as the primary meaning of non‑compensatory for your consensus metric. Include strict conjunctive and outranking/veto approaches as secondary alternatives, and treat lexicographic aggregation as optional (useful only if you can specify a stable priority ordering of criteria). I will produce full metric definitions and incremental update rules for the first three; include lexicographic as an extra if you confirm you need it.\n\nWhy this ranking (concise technical reasons)\n- Limited compensation / soft veto (primary)\n  - Best fit for cardinal [0,1] scores: supports continuous consensus ∈ [0,1] while enforcing strong penalties for low scores on any criterion.\n  - Flexible: can interpolate between strict non‑compensatory (min / hard veto) and more tolerant behavior (Lp norms with small p), so you can tune risk/strictness.\n  - Streaming friendly: metrics (Lp norms, soft-veto adjustments, per-criterion summaries) admit simple incremental updates and per-alternative sufficient statistics.\n  - Interpretable: tuning parameter p or veto thresholds gives a clear handle on non-compensation strength.\n- Strict conjunctive (secondary)\n  - Extremely interpretable and fully non‑compensatory (all criteria must pass thresholds).\n  - Sharp (binary) acceptability unless you convert to a continuous index (e.g., fraction of agents meeting thresholds); good as a baseline and for veto-dominant domains.\n  - Also very cheap to compute and easy to update incrementally.\n- Outranking/veto (secondary)\n  - Social-choice-compatible definition of non‑compensatory consensus (e.g., ELECTRE-style): handles majority comparisons and explicit veto rules across agents.\n  - More complex but valuable when you want pairwise dominance relations and collective veto behavior.\n  - A bit heavier to compute, but still implementable with per-alternative sufficient statistics.\n- Lexicographic (optional)\n  - Very strict form of non-compensation that requires a fixed, reliable priority ordering of criteria — often unrealistic unless domain experts provide that order.\n  - Not recommended as primary because it yields discontinuous behavior and is sensitive to ties/noise.\n\nRecommended default hyperparameter ranges (so I can use these in formulas/code)\n- Per-criterion acceptability threshold t_k (for conjunctive / veto): default 0.6–0.8; use 0.7 as default unless domain risk tolerance suggests otherwise.\n- Soft‑veto tuning via Lp norm: p ∈ (0,1] for non‑compensatory behaviour. Defaults:\n  - p = 1 (linear average) — fully compensatory (baseline).\n  - p = 0.5 — moderate non‑compensation (recommended default).\n  - p → 0 (or use min) — near-strict non‑compensation.\n- Veto threshold (outranking / hard veto): set per-criterion v_k so that score < v_k triggers major penalty; default v_k ∈ [0.2,0.4] below t_k or specify absolute (e.g., v_k = 0.4).\n- Concordance (outranking) threshold c (ELECTRE-style): default 0.6–0.75.\n- Aggregation of agent opinions: use normalized agent weights per-alternative (w_i^(j) = raw_w_i / sum_{i in A_j} raw_w_i).\n- Missing values: ignore missing per-criterion contributions and normalize weights over present entries.\n\nNext steps I’ll take if you confirm this prioritization\n- Provide 3 concrete implementable metrics (one per prioritized meaning): (A) Soft‑veto / Lp-based consensus (primary), (B) Conjunctive thresholding with continuous index, (C) Outranking with veto (ELECTRE-style consensus score). For each I’ll give precise formulas, pseudocode, streaming/incremental update rules, complexity, hyperparameter advice, edge‑case behavior, robust variants, and an experimental protocol.\n- Optionally add a lexicographic metric if you want it included.\n\nQuestion for you (one required confirmation)\n- Confirm: proceed with the three metrics above (soft‑veto/Lp primary, conjunctive, outranking), and omit lexicographic unless requested? If yes, I’ll prepare the full detailed deliverable.",
    "[A2 Question]: Do agents come with known per-agent weights (importance/trust) that you want the consensus metrics to respect, or should all agents be treated equally (with optional learned/estimated weights)?",
    "[A1 Answer]: Answer: support both, with a clear default and precise handling rules.\n\nShort answer / default\n- Default: treat all agents as equal unless you (the system) supply explicit per-agent weights. So use raw weight r_i = 1 for every agent i by default.\n- If you have external weights (trust, expertise) supply nonnegative raw weights r_i ≥ 0. These will be used after normalization per-alternative (see below).\n- Always normalize weights over the agents who actually contributed to the alternative (so results are comparable across varying N and agent churn).\n\nPrecise specification and formulas\n\n1) Raw vs. normalized weights\n- Input: for each agent i a raw weight r_i ∈ [0, ∞). If none provided, set r_i = 1.\n- For alternative j let A_j = {i : agent i provided at least one score for alternative j}.\n- Per-alternative normalized weight:\n  w_i^(j) = r_i / (∑_{i'∈A_j} r_{i'})  for i ∈ A_j.\n  (Agents not in A_j have w_i^(j) = 0.)\n- Use w_i^(j) when computing any weighted aggregate (mean, concordance, Lp etc.). This guarantees ∑_{i} w_i^(j) = 1 and comparability across alternatives and group sizes.\n\n2) Handling missing/partial evaluations\n- If an agent i rated alternative j but omitted some criteria, treat their contribution only on criteria they provided.\n- For per-criterion aggregates (e.g., per-criterion means) normalize weights across agents who provided that criterion:\n  For criterion k on alternative j, A_{j,k} = {i : score s_{i,j,k} observed}.\n  w_i^{(j,k)} = r_i / (∑_{i'∈A_{j,k}} r_{i'}) for i ∈ A_{j,k}.\n- When computing an aggregate that combines criteria (e.g., per-agent Lp of their K scores), compute the per-agent score using the observed criteria only (or impute), but still use w_i^(j) normalized over agents who rated the alternative.\n\n3) Stability / anti-domination safeguards (recommended)\n- Cap maximum normalized weight to prevent a single agent dominating consensus (recommended default cap α_max = 0.20). Implemented as:\n  - Compute preliminary w_i^(j).\n  - If max_i w_i^(j) > α_max, shrink weights via clipping + renormalization:\n    w_i' = min(w_i^(j), α_max); then renormalize over A_j.\n- Alternative: use temperature-controlled softmax on log-weights to damp extremes:\n  w_i^(j) ∝ exp( log(r_i) / T ) with T ≥ 0.1 (T=1 default). Lower T → concentrates mass more; higher T → uniform.\n- Add small floor ε to denominators (ε = 1e-9) to avoid divide-by-zero in degenerate cases (no raters).\n\n4) Learning / estimating weights (optional advanced)\n- If no external r_i but you want reliability-based weights, recommended simple, robust online estimator:\n  - Maintain a running reliability score R_i (e.g., inverse MSE to consensus or to historical ground truth).\n  - One practical formula (streaming, exponential smoothing):\n    Let e_{i,t} = loss of agent i at time t (e.g., MSE between i’s per-alternative composite score and current ensemble composite). Update:\n      R_i ← (1−β) R_i + β * f(e_{i,t})\n    with f(e) = 1 / (1 + e) or f(e) = exp(−λ e). Use β ∈ [0.01,0.1] for stability and λ controlling sensitivity.\n  - Convert to raw weight r_i = (R_i + δ) where δ is a prior (e.g., δ = 0.1) to avoid zeroing inexperienced agents.\n  - Regularize (e.g., shrink towards uniform): r_i ← (1−γ) r_i + γ*mean_r across agents, γ ∈ [0.01,0.1].\n- If ground-truth labels are occasionally available, consider Bayesian updating of per-agent accuracy (Beta-Bernoulli for binary judgments or Gaussian models for continuous scores).\n\n5) Per-criterion / per-alternative weight extensions\n- If you need agent reliability that varies by criterion, allow r_{i,k} (raw weight of agent i for criterion k). Normalize per (j,k) as in §2:\n  w_{i}^{(j,k)} = r_{i,k} / ∑_{i'∈A_{j,k}} r_{i',k}.\n- Keep default behavior simple: only per-agent weights r_i unless you explicitly provide per-criterion weights.\n\n6) Complexity and streaming notes\n- Normalizing weights per alternative requires maintaining S_j = ∑_{i∈A_j} r_i. On agent add/remove or weight change, update S_j in O(1) and recompute affected normalized weights by O(|A_j|) if you need all normalized weights, but typically you only need w_i^(j) for changed agents or to compute weighted aggregates incrementally:\n  - Maintain per-alternative weighted sums (e.g., ∑ w_i^(j) * score_i) using raw r_i and denominator S_j; update aggregates in O(K) when a single agent change occurs.\n- Storage: store raw r_i per agent (size O(N)); per-alternative denominators S_j (size O(M)). For per-criterion weights, store r_{i,k} (size O(NK)).\n\n7) Recommended defaults (concise)\n- If no external weights: r_i = 1 for all i.\n- If external weights: accept r_i ≥ 0; normalize per alternative as above.\n- Safeguard: cap max normalized weight α_max = 0.20 (tunable); floor ε = 1e-9.\n- If you want automatic weight estimation: use exponential smoothing with β = 0.05, f(e)=exp(−λ e) with λ = 5 as a starting point, and a small prior δ = 0.1.\n\nShort rationale\n- Equal default keeps metrics simple, interpretable, and comparable across groups.\n- Allowing external weights supports domains with known expertise/trust.\n- Normalizing per-alternative ensures fair comparison across alternatives and robustness to agent churn.\n- Capping and smoothing prevent domination by a single agent or noisy weight estimates.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Provide pseudocode snippets showing exactly how to incorporate r_i into each of the proposed consensus metrics (soft-veto Lp, conjunctive, outranking), including streaming update routines.",
    "[A3 Question]: What are your real-time requirements for streaming updates — specifically: the maximum acceptable latency per update (e.g., <10 ms, <100 ms, <1 s), the expected update arrival rate (updates/sec or agents joining/leaving per minute), and whether approximate / eventual-consistent (batched) updates are acceptable instead of strict immediate consistency?",
    "[A1 Answer]: Short answer / recommended defaults (given your single-server, moderate‑compute constraint and \"near‑real‑time\" requirement):\n\n- Target latency per single update (end-to-end observable effect on aggregates): ≤200 ms (aim for ≤100 ms if you want snappier interactivity).\n- Typical sustained update arrival rate to support: 100 updates/sec.\n- Peak burst rate to support without data loss (with batching): 500 updates/sec.\n- Allowable staleness / eventual consistency: yes — batching with max staleness = 1 s is acceptable for most monitoring/use cases; if you need stricter semantics for a decision commit, require synchronous update and lower staleness (≤100 ms).\n- If you need true hard real‑time guarantees (<10 ms) or >1k updates/sec sustained, you must scale beyond a single moderate server (sharding, partitioning, or more powerful hardware).\n\nRationale and concrete implications\n\n1) Why these numbers\n- N ≈ 100, M ≈ 20, K ≈ 5 → per‑update work is small (typically O(K) or O(K + per‑criterion constant work)). Thus a single server can handle moderately high rates if you use incremental (constant time) updates and in‑memory data.\n- Latency budget of 100–200 ms gives room for (a) network I/O, (b) thread scheduling, (c) atomic updates to in‑memory aggregates, and (d) occasional small recomputations (e.g., recomputing a per‑alternative consensus that needs only O(1) maintained aggregates).\n- Allowing up to 1 s staleness (eventual consistency) enables efficient batching (e.g., 100–200 ms minibatches) to amortize overhead and handle bursts up to 500/sec on a single server.\n\n2) Operating modes and what they require\n- Interactive mode (UI shows nearly immediate effect): aim ≤100 ms per update. Use per‑update incremental updates (no heavy recompute), lock‑free or fine‑grained locks per alternative, in‑memory arrays, atomic adds for sums, and immediate recompute of C_j (O(K)) on each update.\n- Near‑real‑time monitoring (dashboard acceptable with small delay): latency ≤200–500 ms with mini‑batching every 100–300 ms. This increases throughput (handle bursts) and reduces contention.\n- High‑throughput logging/analytics (not strict immediacy): batch updates up to 1 s and use eventual consistency. Can merge updates in bulk and recompute heavier aggregates (quantiles, robust norms) on a schedule.\n\n3) Concrete update‑rate → design tradeoffs\n- ≤100/sec sustained, ≤200 ms latency: implement simple incremental aggregates (per-agent contributions, per-criterion weighted sums, per-alternative minima/maxima) and recompute metric in O(K) per changed agent/alternative. No batching needed.\n- 100–500/sec bursts: use short batching (window 50–200 ms). Aggregate updates per alternative inside the window and apply a single atomic update to the maintained sufficient statistics per alternative.\n- >500–1000/sec sustained: require horizontal scaling (partition alternatives across worker threads/processes) or stronger hardware.\n\n4) Consistency semantics & suggested defaults\n- Default: eventual consistency with bounded staleness T_stale = 1 s and batch window W = 100–200 ms. This preserves near‑real‑time dashboarding and simplifies throughput.\n- If you require decision‑time consistency (e.g., an accept/reject action must reflect the most recent scores), perform a synchronous recompute for the affected alternative at decision time: use latest values in memory and lock the alternative briefly while computing (O(K) cost).\n- For streaming aggregates that must be deterministic across replicas, use a deterministic merge function (commutative/associative aggregates like sums, counts, minima) so batching order doesn't change result.\n\n5) Practical engineering recommendations to meet targets\n- Keep per‑alternative sufficient statistics in-memory: weighted sums per criterion, weighted Lp accumulator (or store ∑ w * s^p), per‑criterion minima/maxima, counters. This allows O(K) updates.\n- Use fine‑grained concurrency: one mutex/lock per alternative (M ≈ 20 → trivial) or lock‑free atomics for each aggregate. With M small you can partition by alternative cheaply.\n- For quantiles or percentile‑based calibrations, use streaming quantile sketches (t-digest or KLL) — these accept batched updates and are memory/time efficient.\n- For capped agent weights or clipping, maintain per-alternative denominator S_j; updating r_i affects only alternatives the agent rated (store agent→alternatives map).\n- Use batching for bursts: server accumulates incoming updates up to W ms and applies compressed updates per alternative.\n\n6) If you want stricter numbers (answer now)\n- If you require guaranteed per-update latency <50 ms and <10 ms, or sustained >1k updates/sec, tell me which target you need and I’ll provide more aggressive micro‑optimizations and scaling recommendations (threading, sharding, memory layout).\n\nConfirm or adjust\n- If these targets (≤200 ms latency, 100/sec typical, 500/sec peak, staleness ≤1 s) match your operational tolerance I’ll use them as defaults in the algorithm specs, complexity targets, and streaming update pseudocode. If you need lower latency or higher throughput, say which and I’ll adapt the implementation guidance and data structures.",
    "[A4 Question]: Do you want per-agent score calibration to correct for leniency/harshness before computing consensus — and if so, which method should I assume as default: (A) no calibration (raw [0,1] scores), (B) affine rescaling per agent to match a reference mean/SD, or (C) monotonic quantile mapping (percentile/quantile normalization)? If you prefer another method, specify that.",
    "[A1 Answer]: Answer: use (B) affine rescaling per agent to match a reference mean and SD as the default, with a clear fallback rule and an option to switch to (C) monotonic quantile mapping when you detect strong non‑linear usage of the scale. Below are the concrete specs, formulas, streaming updates, defaults and tradeoffs so you can implement reliably.\n\n1) Why default = (B) affine rescaling\n- Lightweight, preserves cardinal magnitudes and distances (important because you treat scores as cardinal).\n- Easy to compute and incremental (Welford or exponential smoothing for mean/variance).\n- Interpretable: you map each agent to the same reference mean/SD (domain semantics e.g., “0.5 is neutral/acceptable”).\n- Works well when agents differ mostly by leniency/harshness (location + scale). If agents distort the shape (clipping, nonlinearity) use (C).\n\n2) Exact affine calibration formula (per agent i)\n- Let s_{i,j,k} be observed score by agent i on alternative j, criterion k in [0,1].\n- Compute agent sample mean μ_i and sample std σ_i (over that agent’s observed scores; see streaming below).\n- Choose reference target mean μ* and target std σ*. Recommended defaults:\n  - μ* = 0.5\n  - σ* = 0.15 (so most mass stays in [0,1]; adjust to domain)\n- Apply affine map:\n  a_i = σ* / max(σ_i_shrunk, σ_min)\n  b_i = μ* − a_i * μ_i_shrunk\n  s'_{i,j,k} = clamp(a_i * s_{i,j,k} + b_i, 0, 1)\n- clamp(x,0,1) = min(max(x,0),1).\n\n3) Shrinkage / small-sample regularization (important)\n- Avoid unstable transforms for low n_i (number of scores by agent). Use Bayesian/shrinkage estimates:\n  μ_i_shrunk = (n_i * μ_i + τ * μ_global) / (n_i + τ)\n  σ_i_shrunk^2 = (n_i * σ_i^2 + τ * σ_global^2) / (n_i + τ)\n  where μ_global, σ_global are running global mean/std across all agents; τ is pseudocount (strength).\n- Recommended defaults:\n  - τ = 20 (requires ~20 observations to trust agent stats)\n  - σ_min = 0.05 (avoid division by near-zero)\n- Alternative exponential smoothing (streaming): maintain EWMA mean/variance with α ≈ 0.01–0.05 and map using current EWMA values; combine shrinkage toward global via convex mix if desired.\n\n4) Streaming / incremental estimation\n- Maintain per-agent sufficient stats:\n  - count n_i\n  - running mean μ_i (Welford or EWMA)\n  - running M2 for variance (Welford) OR EWMA variance.\n- Welford (batch-correct, exact):\n  On new x:\n    n ← n + 1\n    delta ← x − μ\n    μ ← μ + delta / n\n    M2 ← M2 + delta * (x − μ)\n    σ = sqrt( M2 / (n−1) ) for n>1\n- For heavy streaming with concept drift, use EWMA:\n    μ ← (1−α) μ + α x\n    var ← (1−α) var + α (x−μ)^2\n- Maintain global μ_global, σ_global similarly.\n- Recompute a_i,b_i whenever μ_i_shrunk or σ_i_shrunk changes enough (or on each update). Per-agent recalculation is O(1); applying mapping to an agent’s scores in aggregate uses stored transformed contributions (see streaming updates for consensus metrics).\n\n5) Implementation choices & safety\n- Min samples before activating calibration: min_count = 20. Before that, either (i) use no calibration (identity), or (ii) apply shrinkage heavily (τ large).\n- Cap max adjustment (avoid extreme slope): cap a_i ∈ [a_min, a_max], e.g., a_min = 0.5, a_max = 2.0.\n- After affine mapping, always clamp to [0,1].\n- Store both raw and calibrated scores so you can inspect effect and revert if necessary.\n\n6) When to prefer monotonic quantile mapping (C)\n- Use (C) if you detect:\n  - Strong nonlinearity (agents use only ends of scale, or many identical repeated values).\n  - Heavy clipping/bunching (lots of 0/1 or repeated discrete levels).\n  - You need to preserve each agent’s internal ranking but want to align distributions precisely.\n- Implementation note for (C): use t-digest or KLL sketches to estimate quantile functions per agent and global quantile function; transform s → Q_global( F_i(s) ). Streaming-friendly libraries exist (t-digest, KLL). More complex and destroys absolute distances (but preserves ordering within an agent).\n\n7) Diagnostics & automatic switch\n- Compute calibration residual diagnostics per agent:\n  - KL or Wasserstein distance between agent empirical distribution and global distribution (cheap via quantile sketch).\n  - If distance < threshold (default 0.05 L1 quantile distance) → affine is fine.\n  - If distance large and monotonic rank-preserving alignment would reduce distance significantly → consider switching to quantile mapping for that agent.\n- Log histograms / quantiles pre/post calibration for monitoring.\n\n8) Short summary of recommended defaults (copy‑paste ready)\n- Default: affine rescaling (B).\n- Reference: μ* = 0.5, σ* = 0.15.\n- Shrinkage pseudocount τ = 20, min_count = 20.\n- σ_min = 0.05, a ∈ [0.5, 2.0].\n- Streaming estimator: Welford for accuracy, or EWMA with α = 0.02 if you expect drift.\n- Optionally switch to monotonic quantile mapping (C) when distributional distance > 0.1 (tune for domain).\n\n9) Effect on consensus metrics\n- Affine calibration preserves linear relationships and distances so downstream Lp-based soft-veto metrics, conjunctive thresholds, veto rules, and outranking remain meaningful and comparable across agents.\n- Use calibrated scores consistently when computing per-agent composites or per-criterion aggregates; keep raw scores saved for audit.\n\nIf you want, I can provide:\n- Ready-to-run pseudocode for (a) per-agent Welford streaming stats + affine mapping, (b) a t-digest KLL-based quantile calibration alternative, and (c) the integration points where calibration is applied before each of the proposed consensus metrics.",
    "[A2 Question]: Do agents typically rate all M alternatives (dense N×M×K data), or is the rating matrix sparse (each agent rates only a subset of alternatives)? Also: will alternatives themselves be added/removed dynamically in the streaming setting?",
    "[A1 Answer]: Short answer (direct): assume a sparse rating matrix — each agent typically rates only a subset of the M alternatives — and yes, alternatives may be added and removed dynamically. I’ll give precise, implementable specifications and defaults you can use in the framework.\n\nConcrete assumptions / defaults you can change\n- Sparsity: average alternatives rated per agent q (default q = 10 of M = 20). So density ≈ q / M = 0.5 by default; framework works for much sparser cases (q down to 1–5).\n- Minimum raters required to report a stable consensus for an alternative: min_raters = 5 (tunable).\n- New-alternative warm-up: require W = min_raters ratings or a time window T_warm (e.g., 1 minute or 100 updates) before treating C_j as stable; otherwise report C_j with high uncertainty flag.\n- Missing per-criterion values: treat as “not rated” for that (j,k) and compute per-criterion aggregates only over observed entries.\n\nWhy this choice (brief)\n- In realistic multi-agent systems not every agent will evaluate all M options; a sparse design is more flexible and efficient.\n- The consensus definitions you requested (weighted aggregates, Lp/soft‑veto, conjunctive thresholds, outranking) all operate naturally on per-alternative aggregates computed from the subset of raters who provided scores.\n\nData-model & bookkeeping you must maintain\n- Primary sparse storage:\n  - agent→(alternative → K-vector of (possibly partial) scores): per-agent rating map (hash/dict), or a CSR sparse matrix.\n  - alternative→(agent → K-vector): inverted index for fast per-alternative aggregation (hash/dict).\n- Per-alternative sufficient statistics (for alternative j):\n  - S_j = ∑_{i∈A_j} r_i (raw weight denominator).\n  - For each criterion k: sum_{j,k} = ∑_{i∈A_{j,k}} r_i * s_{i,j,k}; count_{j,k} = |A_{j,k}|.\n  - For Lp-based metrics: maintain power sums P_{j,k}^{(p)} = ∑_{i∈A_{j}} r_i * (s_{i,j,k})^p (or per-agent composite powers as needed).\n  - Per-criterion min_{j,k} and other extrema if used by metrics.\n  - Optional: quantile sketch per (j,k) (t-digest / KLL) if you need percentiles or calibration.\n- Per-agent stats (for calibration & weight learning):\n  - n_i, μ_i, σ_i (Welford / EWMA) and list of alternatives rated (for efficient removal on churn).\n\nUpdate semantics (agent add/remove / score change)\n- Agent i adds rating for alternative j:\n  - Insert into agent→alt map and alt→agent map.\n  - Update S_j += r_i; for each observed criterion k: sum_{j,k} += r_i * s_{i,j,k}; count_{j,k} += 1; P_{j,k}^{(p)} += r_i * s^p.\n  - Recompute C_j from updated sufficient stats in O(K) time.\n- Agent i removes rating for j (or leaves system):\n  - Remove mapping, do S_j -= r_i and subtract per-criterion contributions; recompute C_j in O(K).\n  - If S_j becomes 0, treat alternative as unrated and C_j = undefined/NaN.\n- Agent i updates a score on (j,k):\n  - Compute delta and apply to sums and power sums; recompute C_j in O(K).\n- Alternative addition:\n  - Initialize empty S_j = 0 and empty per-criterion aggregates; treat as warm-up until min_raters reached.\n- Alternative removal:\n  - Delete per-alternative aggregates and free inverted index entries.\n\nComplexity and memory (formulas)\n- Storage:\n  - Sparse ratings: O(total_ratings * K) where total_ratings = ∑_i |rated_alternatives_i|. For default N=100, q=10 → total_ratings=1000, so memory trivial.\n  - Per-alternative aggregates: O(M * K).\n  - Per-agent stats: O(N).\n- Update time per single rating addition/change: O(K) to update sufficient stats and recompute C_j.\n  - If you maintain per-criterion quantile sketches, update sketches in amortized O(log n) or O(1) depending on library.\n- If you recompute a global summary across all M alternatives after each update: O(1) to update the few summary scalars using delta to C_j; otherwise O(M) if recomputing from scratch.\n\nImplications for the consensus metrics you asked for\n- Per-alternative normalization: use w_i^(j) = r_i / ∑_{i∈A_j} r_i (only over agents who rated j). This ensures comparability across different numbers of raters.\n- Sparse rating caveat for pairwise outranking metrics: if two alternatives a and b have disjoint rater sets, pairwise comparisons must either:\n  - base outranking on only common raters A_{a} ∩ A_{b}, or\n  - impute missing scores, or\n  - use weighted indirect comparisons (less preferred).\n  Recommendation: prefer common-rater comparisons and report coverage (|A_a ∩ A_b|) used for each pairwise result. If coverage is low, mark outranking as uncertain.\n- For conjunctive thresholds: compute fraction (or weighted fraction) of raters who meet per-criterion thresholds. With sparsity, denominator per (j,k) is |A_{j,k}| (raters who provided that criterion). Require min_raters to reduce volatility.\n- For Lp/soft-veto metrics: power sums P_{j,k}^{(p)} computed from present raters suffice; missing criteria are simply absent from those sums.\n\nRobustness & small-sample handling (sparse-specific)\n- Don’t report raw C_j until at least min_raters; before that return a prior or Bayesian posterior with high uncertainty.\n- Provide confidence intervals: bootstrap over the observed rater set A_j (resample with replacement) to estimate variance of C_j; with small |A_j| use parametric priors.\n- For calibration and weight estimation, use shrinkage toward global stats (τ = 20): important when agents rate very few alternatives.\n\nConcurrency & streaming recommendations\n- With M small (≈20) simplest approach: one lock per alternative for safe concurrent updates. Each update touches only one alternative’s aggregates → low contention.\n- If M large or q large: partition alternatives across workers.\n- Use batching W_ms (default 100–200 ms) to group updates and apply per-alternative delta updates in bulk if throughput bursts occur.\n\nDiagnostics to surface for sparse data\n- Per-alternative: |A_j|, per-criterion counts |A_{j,k}|, coverage fraction |A_j|/N, and confidence interval for C_j.\n- For pairwise/outranking reporting: coverage |A_a ∩ A_b| and an uncertainty flag if coverage < threshold (e.g., < min_raters).\n\nEdge cases & design choices you may want to revisit\n- Extremely sparse regime (many alternatives, each rated by very few agents): increase min_raters or require active sampling to obtain more ratings for important alternatives.\n- Disjoint rater groups across alternatives: global summaries may be misleading — consider grouping agents or stratified summaries by agent clusters.\n- If alternatives are frequently added/removed, tune warm-up thresholds for acceptable latency vs. statistical reliability.\n\nShort checklist you can implement now\n- Treat rating matrix as sparse; implement agent→alts and alt→agents maps.\n- Maintain per-alternative aggregates S_j, sum_{j,k}, count_{j,k}, P_{j,k}^{(p)}.\n- Update aggregates and recompute C_j in O(K) per rating change.\n- Require min_raters before reporting stable C_j; provide uncertainty intervals using bootstrap or analytic variance where available.\n- For pairwise/outranking methods only compare on common raters and report coverage.\n\nIf you want, I can now produce:\n- Exact pseudocode for the sparse storage + incremental updates (add/change/remove rating, add/remove alternative).\n- Integration of these routines into each proposed consensus metric (soft-veto Lp, conjunctive threshold, outranking) including how to handle disjoint raters in outranking."

        "understanding": "Refined understanding (1–2 sentences)\n- You want a small set (2–4) of implementable, mathematically precise non‑compensatory consensus metrics for N≈100 agents × M≈20 alternatives × K≈5 cardinal criteria in [0,1], together with pseudocode, complexity, hyperparameter guidance, robustness checks, incremental update methods (streaming/agent churn), and a small synthetic-experiment plan to compare them.  \n- Default assumptions I will use unless you tell me otherwise: scores are cardinal in [0,1] (you confirmed this), produce a per‑alternative consensus index C_a ∈ [0,1] (you can aggregate across alternatives later), and agents are equal-weighted by default (supporting optional weights).\n\nQuick questions / defaults I’ll use (please confirm if you want different choices)\n- Per‑alternative consensus indices (C_a) — default; if you need a single-group index I’ll give aggregation rules (mean, weighted mean, min).  \n- Agent weights: default equal (w_i = 1/N); support custom weights normalized per alternative.  \n- Non‑compensatory semantics: I’ll provide (A) strict conjunctive thresholds (no trade-offs), (B) lexicographic priority, (C) max-deficit / Chebyshev (only worst shortfall matters), and (D) outranking with veto (Electre-style) — these cover strict to “limited compensation” interpretations.  \n- Real-time latency target: near‑real‑time (<100 ms per single update typical). If you need sub‑ms or much larger N, tell me.\n\nBelow are four candidate metrics. For each I give: definition (equations), continuous version where applicable, pseudocode, complexity, hyperparameter guidance, edge-case behavior, incremental update notes, and short comments about use.\n\nNotation\n- s_{i,a,k} ∈ [0,1] = score by agent i ∈ {1..N} for alternative a ∈ {1..M} on criterion k ∈ {1..K}.  \n- w_i ≥ 0 = agent weight (default w_i = 1). Normalize W = Σ_i w_i.  \n- t_k ∈ [0,1] = per‑criterion acceptability threshold (if used).  \n- v_k ∈ [0,1] = veto level (if used).  \n- All consensus indices produce C_a ∈ [0,1].\n\nMetric 1 — Conjunctive threshold (strict non‑compensation), with soft/continuous variant\nDefinition (hard binary):\n- Agent i finds alternative a acceptable iff for all criteria k: s_{i,a,k} ≥ t_k.  \n- A_{i,a} = 1 iff min_k I[s_{i,a,k} ≥ t_k] = 1, else 0.  \n- Consensus: C1_a = (Σ_i w_i A_{i,a}) / W.\n\nContinuous (soft) variant (recommended for continuous index):\n- Per‑criterion normalized margin φ_{i,a,k} = clamp((s_{i,a,k} − t_k)/(1 − t_k), 0, 1). (If t_k=1 treat as hard fail unless equals 1.)  \n- Agent degree d_{i,a} = min_k φ_{i,a,k}  (min operator enforces non‑compensation).  \n- Consensus: C1_a = (Σ_i w_i d_{i,a}) / W.\n\nPseudocode (vectorized outline)\n- Input: S[N,M,K], thresholds t[K], weights w[N]\n- For each a: for each i: compute φ = clamp((S[i,a,:] − t) / (1 − t), 0, 1) ; d[i] = min_k φ[k]  \n- C1[a] = sum_i w[i]*d[i] / W\n\nComplexity\n- Time: O(N·M·K) full compute.  \n- Memory: O(N·M·K) to store scores; intermediate O(N) per alternative if streaming per a.\n\nHyperparameters and defaults\n- t_k: default 0.6 (moderate acceptability) — tune by domain risk; for conservative systems use >=0.7. If criteria have different importance, scale t_k accordingly (higher importance → higher t_k).  \n- Weights: default equal.\n\nEdge cases\n- If any t_k=1 then only perfect scores pass (hard).  \n- Identical agents: metric scales to 0/1 based on their identical evaluations; average unaffected by duplication if weights normalized.  \n- Skewed scale: calibration (see Implementation) may be needed if agents use scales differently.\n\nIncremental/streaming updates (fast)\n- Maintain per-agent per-alternative d_{i,a} or just recompute for changed agent i: recompute d_{i,a} across K in O(K) and update C1_a by adjusting numerator and W. When agents join/leave update W. This is O(K) per single-agent update (sublinear in N, independent of N).\n\nPros/cons\n- Pros: strictly non‑compensatory, interpretable, very fast, simple to explain.  \n- Cons: hard thresholds require calibration; very sensitive to threshold placement; being strict can make consensus low even when most criteria are slightly below t.\n\nMetric 2 — Lexicographic agreement (priority ordering of criteria)\nGoal\n- Non‑compensatory in that higher‑priority criteria dominate any lower‑priority differences.\n\nDefinition\n- Fix criterion order P = [p1, p2, … pK] (p1 highest priority). Choose tie margin δ_k ≥ 0 for each criterion to avoid noise flips.  \n- Compute reference vector r_a (group reference) per alternative; default r_a,k = weighted median across agents of s_{i,a,k} (robust). Alternative: mean if you prefer magnitude.  \n- For agent i and alternative a: find first priority index k* where |s_{i,a,k*} − r_{a,k*}| > δ_{k*}. If none → agent \"ties\" (count as agreement fraction = 1). Else agent \"agrees\" if s_{i,a,k*} ≥ r_{a,k*} (they are as good or better on first distinguishing criterion), else \"disagrees\".  \n- Hard consensus: C2_a = (Σ_i w_i [agree_i]) / W.  \n- Soft consensus: define soft logistic on first-difference: score_i = σ( α*(s_{i,a,k*} − r_{a,k*}) ) where σ is logistic in [0,1] and α controls steepness; if no k* then score_i = 1. Then C2_a = (Σ_i w_i score_i)/W.\n\nPseudocode\n- Compute r_a,k = median_i s_{i,a,k} for all k.  \n- For each agent i: loop k in P: if abs(s_{i,a,k}-r_a,k) > δ_k: k* = k; break else continue. If no k*: score_i = 1. Else score_i = 1 if s_{i,a,k*} ≥ r_a,k*, else 0 (or logistic soft).  \n- C2[a] = sum_i w[i]*score_i / W.\n\nComplexity\n- Computing medians: naive O(N log N) per (a,k) or use streaming quantile summaries (see Implementation). Overall full compute O(N·M·K log N) if medians by sorting, or O(N·M·K) with linear-time median algorithms or approximate quantiles. Per-agent scoring O(N·K·M). Streaming updates: update quantile summaries O(log N) per new point; recompute affected agent scores for the given alternative.\n\nHyperparameters and defaults\n- Priority order P: set by domain experts; if not available use criteria ordered by variance or by average importance.  \n- δ_k: default small (0.02–0.05) to avoid ties due to noise; set relative to measurement noise.  \n- α (soft slope): default 20 (steep logistic ~ near threshold).\n\nEdge cases\n- Ties: no k* → agent counts as agreement (you can instead count as 0.5).  \n- Identical agents: identical behavior; median equals their score → all tie → consensus = 1. That may be undesirable if identical group extreme — consider defining reference as trimmed mean to avoid degenerate unanimity.  \n- Skewed scales: median reduces influence of outliers.\n\nIncremental/streaming updates\n- Maintain streaming quantiles per (a,k) using t-digest/GK. When quantile changes, affected agent comparisons may change — naive approach recomputes agent scores for that alternative only (O(N·K) worst-case), but in practice changes to medians are small so a small subset of agents flip. For strict low-latency, maintain for each agent i its first-discriminating criterion index and update only if r_a,k moved across δ_k relative to s_{i,a,k}. Typical per-update cost O(#agents whose comparisons cross boundary), often small.\n\nPros/cons\n- Pros: honors priority order, interpretable, handles tie-breaking.  \n- Cons: requires domain ordering and careful calibration of margins; may treat minor differences in top criteria as decisive.\n\nMetric 3 — Max‑deficit (Chebyshev / L_∞ style) distance-to-threshold\nDefinition\n- For each agent i and alternative a define per-criterion deficit d_{i,a,k} = max(0, t_k − s_{i,a,k]) (how far below threshold). Weighted per-criterion deficits optionally by importance weights u_k ≥ 0 (normalization Σ u_k = 1).  \n- Agent deficit D_{i,a} = max_k u_k · d_{i,a,k}  (Chebyshev selects largest shortfall → prevents compensation).  \n- Normalize by max_possible_deficit = max_k u_k · t_k (or 1 if u_k normalized): define normalized deficit ND_{i,a} ∈ [0,1].  \n- Consensus: C3_a = 1 − (Σ_i w_i ND_{i,a}) / W  (so C3_a = 1 when no deficits, 0 when max deficits everywhere).\n\nVariants\n- Use L_p norm with small p (e.g., p=1/∞) — p→∞ approaches Chebyshev. Using p small reduces compensation; p=1 is compensatory (not desired). Choose p large to emphasize worst criterion.\n\nPseudocode\n- For each (i,a): compute deficits = max(0, t − s[i,a,:]) ; D = max_k u[k]*deficits[k] ; ND = D / max_possible_deficit ; accumulate.\n\nComplexity\n- Time: O(N·M·K). Memory: O(N·M·K).\n\nHyperparameters and defaults\n- t_k: as in Metric 1 (default 0.6).  \n- u_k: criterion importance weights — default equal. If some criteria are critical, set u_k higher (increases chance to dominate max).  \n- Normalization: ND uses max_possible_deficit = max_k u_k t_k >0.\n\nEdge cases\n- If all t_k = 0 then ND=0, consensus=1 (degenerate).  \n- If u_k concentrated on one criterion, metric reduces to that criterion's deficits.  \n- Skewed scales: deficits robust to scaling if thresholds set in same units.\n\nIncremental/streaming updates\n- Per single-agent update, recompute D_{i,a} in O(K) and adjust aggregated sum. Maintains O(K) per update.\n\nPros/cons\n- Pros: clearly non‑compensatory (max operator), interpretable as distance-to-meeting thresholds, simple incremental updates.  \n- Cons: requires thresholds and criterion-importance weights; sensitive to which criterion is max.\n\nMetric 4 — Outranking / ELECTRE‑style consensus with veto\nRationale\n- Outranking methods explicitly model concordance (criteria that “support” an alternative) and discordance (veto on critical criteria). They are commonly used for non‑compensatory group judgments.\n\nDefinition (per alternative, agent-centric outranking toward group reference)\n- Reference r_a,k = group aggregator (median or mean). For agent i and criterion k define concordance indicator c_{i,a,k} = 1 if s_{i,a,k} ≥ r_{a,k} − p_k, where p_k is concordance slack (preference threshold), else 0. Concordance score C_{i,a} = Σ_k u_k c_{i,a,k} (weighted fraction of criteria in agreement).  \n- Veto: if any criterion k has s_{i,a,k} ≤ v_k (veto level) then agent vetoes that alternative regardless of concordance. Represent V_{i,a} = 1 if ∃k s_{i,a,k} ≤ v_k else 0.  \n- Agent “accepts” if (C_{i,a} ≥ c_bar) AND (V_{i,a} = 0). Aggregate consensus: C4_a = (Σ_i w_i accept_{i,a})/W. Soft versions can use continuous concordance scores instead of threshold c_bar.\n\nPseudocode\n- Compute r_a,k (median). For each i: compute c_k = (s[i,a,k] ≥ r_a,k − p_k) ; Cscore = Σ u_k c_k ; veto = any(s[i,a,k] ≤ v_k) ; accept = (Cscore ≥ c_bar) and not veto. C4[a] = sum_i w[i]*accept / W.\n\nComplexity\n- Time: O(N·M·K). Memory: O(N·M·K).\n\nHyperparameters and defaults\n- p_k (preference slack): default 0.02–0.05.  \n- u_k: criterion weights; default equal.  \n- v_k (veto levels): set near 0.2–0.4 for critical criteria; if veto not desired set v_k = 0.  \n- c_bar (concordance threshold): default 0.6 (60% of weighted criteria in agreement).\n\nEdge cases\n- If v_k≥r_a,k then many vetoes may occur — tune v_k carefully.  \n- Identical agents: yields accept/reject behavior based on r_a (could be degenerate if r_a equals agents’ scores).\n\nIncremental/streaming updates\n- Maintain r_a,k via streaming quantiles; recompute accept flags for agents whose comparison to r_a changes (like Metric 2). Maintain counts of accept/veto per a; per single agent update cost O(K).\n\nPros/cons\n- Pros: flexible and explainable (concordance + veto), widely used for non‑compensatory requirements.  \n- Cons: many hyperparameters; requires careful tuning; computing reference r_a introduces circularity when many agents change.\n\nAggregation & linkage to decisions (common for all metrics)\n- Per‑alternative thresholding: accept alternative a if C_a ≥ τ_accept (τ_accept default 0.6–0.8 depending on risk).  \n- Select-best: choose alternative(s) maximizing C_a (argmax). You can combine with average utility U_a = Σ_i w_i u_i,a ; then tradeoffs:\n  - Choose alternatives maximizing C_a subject to U_a ≥ u_min (satisfy consensus then utility).  \n  - Multi-objective: Pareto frontier of (C_a, U_a) and select top by domain policy.  \n- Shortlist: top-L by C_a or those with C_a ≥ τ_low and then rank by U_a.  \n- Trade-offs: maximizing consensus favors safe, broadly-acceptable options; maximizing average utility can favor polarizing but high-utility options. Choose rule consistent with decision policy (e.g., safety-first → consensus-first).\n\nRobustness & statistical validation\n- Null models / baselines\n  - Permutation test: permute agents’ labels per alternative (or shuffle scores across agents) preserving marginals; recompute C_a → empirical null. p-value = fraction of null ≥ observed. Complexity: O(B·N·M·K) for B permutations; you can do B=1000 for offline, less for online.  \n  - Bootstrap: resample agents with replacement to get CI for C_a (useful for stability).  \n  - Independent noise model: generate s_{i,a,k} ∼ independent Beta or Gaussian(µ_k,σ_k) fit to data marginals; compare observed C_a to distribution.\n- Sensitivity tests\n  - Single-agent influence: compute influence by removing each agent (or small coalition) and measuring ΔC_a. High sensitivity indicates vulnerability.  \n  - Adversarial flips: flip one agent’s scores to extremes and compute ΔC_a to measure robustness.\n- Robust variants\n  - Trimmed/median aggregation: use medians or trimmed means for references to reduce outlier influence.  \n  - Majority-veto protection: require that a minimum fraction (e.g., >50%) of agents have no vetoing deficits (for conjunctive metrics).  \n  - Winsorize or clip extreme scores.  \n  - Replace mean with Huber/M-estimators for soft aggregations.\n\nDynamic updates and maintenance (practical incremental algorithms)\n- Principle: maintain per‑alternative aggregates or per‑agent degrees so single agent changes require O(K) work, not O(N). Suggested maintained structures:\n  - For Metric 1: store numerator S1_a = Σ_i w_i d_{i,a}, and W. On agent i update: recompute d_{i,a} (O(K)), update S1_a ← S1_a + w_i*(d_new − d_old). Complexity O(K) per agent update.  \n  - For Metric 2 & 4: maintain streaming quantile summaries (t-digest, GK) per (a,k) to update reference r_a,k in O(log N) amortized; maintain per-agent score and invert when r changes by >δ_k you may need to recompute only agents for which s_{i,a,k} crosses threshold (efficient if you maintain sorted indices or bucketing). Worst-case recompute O(N) but average small.  \n  - For Metric 3: store per-agent D_{i,a} and sum; on update recompute in O(K).  \n- Agent churn: when agent joins add its contributions; when leaves subtract. Normalize W each time. If you need exact per‑agent history, store d_{i,a} for each i,a (memory O(N·M)) — feasible for N=100, M=20.\n\nImplementation guidance & libraries\n- Data layout: store S as float array shape (M, K, N) or (N, M, K). For streaming per-alternative operations, prefer (M, K, N) for cache locality. Use float32.  \n- Vectorization: use NumPy (vectorized min, max, logical ops), or Pandas for convenience; use Numba for low-level hot loops on updates.  \n- Streaming quantiles: use t-digest (good for medians and tails), GK algorithm or Apache DataSketches, for O(log n) updates and small memory. Python libraries: tdigest, crick (approx quantiles), or streaming-quantiles packages.  \n- Sparse/missing values: store missing as NaN; compute per-a/K operations ignoring NaNs; normalize weights over present agents. Use masked arrays in NumPy.  \n- Parallelism: compute per-alternative in parallel across CPUs (M=20 so trivial).  \n- Approximate quantile & summaries: use t-digest for median r_a,k updates.  \n- Storage: to support incremental updates keep per-agent per-alternative degree arrays (N×M) for O(2k) additional memory; for N=100 M=20 this is tiny.\n\nSmall synthetic experiment plan (to compare metrics)\n- Goals: measure discriminative power (separating high-consensus vs low-consensus populations), stability (bootstrap CI width), robustness to noise/adversary, and runtime.\n- Generator parameters:\n  - Create C clusters of agents (C small e.g., 1–4). For each cluster c define latent true scores µ_{c,a,k} ∈ [0,1] for each a,k. Generate agents in cluster c with s_{i,a,k} = clip(µ_{c,a,k} + bias_i + scale_i * ϵ, 0, 1) where ϵ ∼ Normal(0,σ^2). bias_i ∼ Uniform(-b,b) models leniency; scale_i ∼ Uniform(0.8,1.2).  \n  - Control inter-cluster separation by adjusting µ differences (high-consensus: one cluster dominates with small σ; low-consensus: two opposite clusters with differing µs).  \n  - Inject missingness at rate p_miss (e.g., 0.0, 0.1, 0.3).  \n  - Inject adversarial agents that set scores to extremes for subset of alternatives.\n- Scenarios to test:\n  - Baseline: single cluster, low noise (expect high consensus).  \n  - Polarized: two equal-size clusters with opposing µ (expect low consensus).  \n  - Near-miss: all agents near thresholds (test threshold sensitivity).  \n  - Missing data: random missingness patterns.  \n- Evaluation metrics:\n  - Discriminative power: ability to separate baseline vs polarized via C_a distributions; e.g., compute AUC for distinguishing scenarios.  \n  - Stability: CI width from bootstrap (1000 resamples) for C_a.  \n  - Robustness: ΔC_a under single-agent adversarial flip (max Δ when flipping one agent) and under k-agent coalition.  \n  - Runtime: time to compute full metric and time per single-agent update.  \n- Procedure:\n  - For each scenario, simulate R replicates (R≥50) and collect metrics above for each consensus method. Compare.\n\nPractical recommended defaults (starter configuration)\n- Use Metric 1 (soft conjunctive min) as primary non‑compensatory index: t_k = 0.6, map φ = clamp((s−t)/(1−t),0,1), d = min_k φ; consensus C1_a = mean_i d_{i,a}. Simple and interpretable.  \n- Use Metric 3 (Chebyshev deficit) as complementary measure — gives alternative view where worst deficit is explicit. t_k same as Metric 1; u_k equal unless critical differences.  \n- Use Metric 4 (outranking with veto) when you need explainability with veto/major criteria.  \n- Use Metric 2 (lexicographic) only if you have an authoritative priority ordering among criteria.\n\nHow to aggregate single‑alternative indices into a single group index\n- Mean across alternatives: C_group = (1/M) Σ_a C_a (interpretable average agreement).  \n- Conservative global: min_a C_a (worst‑case consensus across alternatives).  \n- Weighted by alternative importance p_a: Σ_a p_a C_a.\n\nRecommended threshold τ for decisions\n- If using conjunctive metrics use τ_accept = 0.7 for moderate acceptance, 0.8–0.9 for conservative decisions. Choose via simulation using your data and desired false‑accept rate under null.\n\nImplementation checklist & tips\n- Preprocess: optionally calibrate agent harshness by per-agent affine rescaling to match a reference mean/SD (monotonic), or prefer monotonic rank→quantile normalization if very heterogeneous. Keep calibration monotonic to preserve thresholds.  \n- Missingness: per alternative normalize weights over present agents; when many missing values for an (a,k) set an “insufficient evidence” flag.  \n- Logging: track per-agent influence (ΔC upon removal) to identify manipulative agents.\n\nConcise summary of complexities (full recompute)\n- All four metrics: O(N·M·K) time for full recompute. Memory dominated by storing S of size O(N·M·K). Updates of a single agent: typically O(K) for Metrics 1 & 3, O(K + expected small # flips) for Metrics 2 & 4 (due to quantile/reference churn). These meet your moderate‑compute, near‑real‑time needs for N=100, M=20, K=5.\n\nRemaining choices where I’d like your confirmation\n1. Per‑alternative or single-group index? (I used per-alternative by default.)  \n2. Agent weights known or equal? (I used equal default; I can incorporate pre-specified weights.)  \n3. Do you want me to provide ready-to-run reference code (Python + NumPy/Numba + tdigest) for one or more of these metrics? If yes, which metric(s) would you like first?\n\nIf you confirm the three clarifications above, I can (a) provide compact, ready-to-run Python implementations for the 2–3 recommended metrics (including incremental update functions), and (b) provide example synthetic data generation code and a small test harness to compute the experiment metrics and plots."

        "understanding": "Understanding (1–2 sentences)\nYou want a set of concrete, implementable group-consensus metrics for multi-criteria, multi-agent evaluations that are explicitly non‑compensatory (poor performance on any critical criterion cannot be fully traded off by other criteria), together with algorithms, complexity, choices to make, robustness/validation procedures, and incremental update methods suitable for near‑real‑time aggregation for N≈100, M≈20, K≈5.\n\nBefore I design the methods I’ll use the following defaults unless you prefer otherwise (I’ll also ask 4 quick clarifying questions):\n- Scores are cardinal on [0,1]. Consensus is computed per alternative (you can aggregate across alternatives later). Non‑compensatory requirement will be implemented via conjunctive / veto / max‑shortfall / lexicographic constructions rather than pure averaging.\n- Default thresholds t_k = 0.6 for acceptability and veto thresholds v_k = 0.4, unless you specify different domain knowledge.\nClarifying questions (quick; answer any or I’ll use defaults above)\n1. Do you require a single consensus index per alternative (recommended), or also a single index summarizing the whole set of alternatives?  \n2. Are agent weights known/required, or should we assume equal weighting by default?  \n3. Do you want strict conjunctive semantics (every criterion must pass its threshold for an agent to accept) or softer “limited compensation” (max‑shortfall, small‑p norms)?  \n4. Real‑time latency target per update (e.g., <100ms, <1s) and expected update granularity (single agent score change vs. batch updates)?\n\nProposed approaches (4 non‑compensatory metrics). For each I give: definition, formula, pseudocode, complexity, hyperparameter guidance, edge cases.\n\nNotation\n- N agents indexed i, M alternatives j, K criteria k.\n- s_{i,j,k} ∈ [0,1] is score of agent i for alternative j on criterion k. Missing values allowed.\n- w_i ≥ 0 is agent weight (Σ_i w_i normalized to 1 if weights used).\n- t_k ∈ [0,1] is acceptance threshold per criterion; v_k ∈ [0,1] is veto threshold (v_k ≤ t_k typically).\n- For brevity let A_j denote the consensus value for alternative j ∈ [0,1] (1 = full consensus to accept / agree; 0 = no consensus).\n\n1) Conjunctive (threshold) consensus — fraction of agents for which all criteria meet thresholds\nDefinition\nAgent i “accepts” alternative j if min_k s_{i,j,k} ≥ t_k (i.e., every criterion meets its threshold). Consensus A_j is the weighted fraction of agents accepting j:\nA_j = (Σ_i w_i · I[∀k: s_{i,j,k} ≥ t_k]) / Σ_i w_i\n(I[·] is indicator; for equal weights use 1/N.)\n\nPseudocode (vectorized style)\n- Input: S (N×M×K), t (K), w (N) or None\nfor j in 1..M:\n  accept_mask = True-vector length N\n  for k in 1..K:\n    accept_mask = accept_mask AND (S[:,j,k] >= t[k])  # treat missing as False or use imputation\n  A[j] = sum(w[accept_mask]) / sum(w)\n\nComplexity\n- Time: O(N·M·K) to evaluate all alternatives.\n- Memory: O(N·M·K) input; can stream by alternative to use O(N·K) working memory.\n\nHyperparameters & setting\n- t_k: choose by domain; default 0.6. If criteria scales differ, normalize or set t_k per criterion via domain acceptability (e.g., using historical medians or expert elicitation).\n- Missing values: treat missing as “not meeting” (conservative) or impute with agent mean/median only if justified.\n\nBehavior / edge cases\n- Ties: exact equality included via ≥. If many scores equal to threshold, that’s fine.\n- Identical agents: duplicates weighted via w_i; if equal weighting and many duplicates, consensus reflects duplication — you can deduplicate or cap weights.\n- Skewed scales: thresholding is scale-sensitive; threshold should be per-criterion normalized.\n\nInterpretation\n- Very interpretable: fraction of agents who find the alternative acceptable on every criterion.\n- Strongly non‑compensatory: any low criterion fails the agent’s accept and removes them from count.\n\n2) Veto-aware outranking consensus (ELECTRE-style, concordance + discordance)\nDefinition\nExtend conjunctive idea by allowing partial concordance but with veto: compute concordance C_{i,j} (how many/weighted criteria pass agent i’s acceptance thresholds), and discordance D_{i,j} (if any criterion below veto v_k then agent vetoes). Define agent i “does not oppose” j if not vetoed and concordance sufficiently high (e.g., fraction of criteria passing ≥ α). Consensus A_j = weighted fraction of agents who do not oppose j.\n\nFormally:\npass_{i,j,k} = 1 if s_{i,j,k} ≥ t_k else 0\nconcordance_{i,j} = (1/K) Σ_k pass_{i,j,k}\nveto_{i,j} = I[exists k such that s_{i,j,k} ≤ v_k]   (strict veto)\nAgent supports if (veto_{i,j} == 0) AND (concordance_{i,j} ≥ α). Then\nA_j = Σ_i w_i · I[support_{i,j}] / Σ_i w_i\n\nPseudocode\nfor j in 1..M:\n  pass = (S[:,j,:] >= t[None,:])  # N×K boolean\n  concord = mean(pass, axis=1)\n  veto = any(S[:,j,:] <= v[None,:], axis=1)  # bool\n  support = (veto == False) & (concord >= alpha)\n  A[j] = sum(w[support]) / sum(w)\n\nComplexity\n- Time: O(N·M·K).\n- Memory: similar to conjunctive.\n\nHyperparameters & setting\n- v_k: veto thresholds; conservative choice v_k = t_k - δ (e.g., δ = 0.2), or set by domain.\n- α ∈ [0,1]: required concordance fraction (e.g., α = 0.6 meaning at least 60% criteria must meet thresholds).\n- Choose α to tune tradeoff between strict conjunctive (α→1) and permissive.\n\nBehavior / edge cases\n- If α is low and v_k high, close to simple non‑veto averaging. If v_k very low, veto rarely triggers.\n- Ties: concordance handles ties by counting ≥.\n- More robust to minor failings than pure conjunctive, but still non‑compensatory via veto.\n\n3) Max‑shortfall (L∞) consensus — normalized max shortfall per agent\nDefinition\nSet per-criterion target t_k (could be same t_k as above). For agent i on j, shortfall d_{i,j} = max_k max(0, t_k − s_{i,j,k}) ∈ [0,1]. Lower shortfall = closer to meeting all criteria. Define consensus A_j as 1 − normalized (weighted) mean shortfall:\nA_j = 1 − (Σ_i w_i · d_{i,j}) / max_possible_shortfall\nIf t_k ≤ 1 and s ≥0, max_possible_shortfall = max_k t_k (or 1 if you want full normalization). For simplicity normalize by T = max_k t_k, so A_j ∈ [0,1].\n\nPseudocode\nT = max(t)\nfor j in 1..M:\n  shortfalls = maximum( t[None,:] - S[:,j,:], 0 ) # N×K\n  d = max(shortfalls, axis=1)  # L_infty per agent\n  A[j] = 1 - dot(w, d) / (sum(w) * T)\n\nComplexity\n- Time: O(N·M·K)\n- Memory: O(N·K) per alternative if streaming\n\nHyperparameters & setting\n- t_k: target levels; normalization T = max_k t_k (or average t_k). If you want stronger penalties on worst criterion use T = 1.\n- This metric respects cardinal shortfalls and is explicitly non‑compensatory because only the worst criterion matters per agent.\n\nBehavior / edge cases\n- If an agent misses one criterion badly but excels others, agent contributes low A (penalized by max), matching your non‑compensatory desire.\n- Identical agents: averaged via weights.\n- If all t_k=0, A_j = 1 always (degenerate).\n\nInterpretation\n- Continuous index in [0,1] capturing degree to which agents as a group avoid any large shortfalls on any criterion.\n\n4) Lexicographic depth consensus — first-failure depth distribution\nDefinition\nRequires a total order of criteria by importance (k1 ≻ k2 ≻ ...). For agent i and alternative j, find the earliest criterion in lexicographic order where s_{i,j,·} < t_{·}. Let depth d_{i,j} be that index (1..K) where failure occurs, or K+1 if none fail. High depth means agent survives many priority criteria. Consensus A_j is normalized expected depth (or weighted fraction reaching full acceptance):\nA_j = (Σ_i w_i · d_{i,j}) / ((K+1)·Σ_i w_i)\nThis yields A_j ∈ (0,1] (map to [0,1] with (K+1) normalization). Alternatively report fraction with d=K+1 (full pass).\n\nPseudocode\norder = [k1, k2, ..., kK]\nfor j in 1..M:\n  d = zeros(N)\n  for i in 1..N:\n    for pos, k in enumerate(order, start=1):\n      if s[i,j,k] < t[k]:\n        d[i] = pos\n        break\n    if no break: d[i] = K+1\n  A[j] = dot(w, d) / ((K+1)*sum(w))\n\nComplexity\n- Time: worst O(N·M·K) (early exit reduces average cost if failures common early)\n- Memory: O(1) extra per alternative if streaming.\n\nHyperparameters & setting\n- criterion order: elicited from domain experts or learned from historical decisions. If unknown, use importance weights to derive order by descending importance.\n- thresholds t_k as before.\n\nBehavior / edge cases\n- If many agents fail early on first criterion, consensus low.\n- Lexicographic is strongly non‑compensatory: lower priority criteria do not rescue failure on higher priority ones.\n- Ties and identical agents handled naturally.\n\nAggregation & linking consensus to decisions\nGeneral patterns:\n- Acceptance rule: accept alternative j if A_j ≥ τ_accept. Choose τ_accept = 0.5 by default (majority) or raise for stricter consensus (0.7–0.9).\n- Shortlist: pick top-L alternatives by A_j (e.g., top 3).\n- Final choice: pick alternative maximizing a composite objective f(A_j, U_j) where U_j is average group utility (e.g., mean across agents and criteria). Tradeoffs:\n  - Maximizing A_j favors options with broad, non‑compensatory acceptability; may reduce average utility if high consensus occurs at mediocre utility.\n  - Max average utility favors options that some agents love at expense of others; less robust to vetoes.\nHybrid rule examples:\n  - Constrained optimization: pick alternatives that meet A_j ≥ τ (feasibility) then maximize mean utility among them.\n  - Lexicographic selection: first require A_j above τ, then select by U_j.\n\nRobustness, null models and validation\nNull models / significance testing\n- Permutation test: randomize agent labels across alternatives (or shuffle each criterion independently preserving marginal distributions) and recompute A_j repeatedly to build null distribution; compute p-value of observed A_j.\n- Bootstrap: resample agents with replacement and compute CI on A_j; wide CI indicates instability.\n- Independent-noise model: generate agents with i.i.d. scores drawn from fitted marginals (e.g., Beta fitted per criterion) and compare observed A_j to distribution.\n\nSensitivity to noise, misreports, missing values\n- Missing values: treat as fail (conservative) or impute with agent median or criterion median and flag imputed cases in analysis.\n- Misreports / adversarial agents: use robust weighting (trim top/bottom x% of weighted influence), Huberization, medoid-based aggregation instead of mean, or cap maximum weight per agent.\n- Robust variants: for shortfall metric use trimmed mean or median-of-means across agents; for threshold metrics maintain counts but use median acceptance across bootstrap resamples.\n\nDiagnostics to run\n- Influence analysis: remove one agent at a time (or clusters) to measure change in A_j.\n- Clustered agents: if agents cluster, many may be redundant — detect via similarity and optionally de-weight clusters.\n\nDynamic updates and streaming handling\nKey idea: precompute and maintain compact per-alternative summaries so single-agent updates are O(K) or O(K·changes_in_alternatives) instead of O(N).\n\nData structures to maintain (defaults)\n- For conjunctive/veto/alpha concordance:\n  - counts_pass[j,k] = Σ_i w_i · I[s_{i,j,k} ≥ t_k]  (size M×K)\n  - counts_veto[j] = Σ_i w_i · I[exists k: s_{i,j,k} ≤ v_k]  (size M)\n  - counts_accept[j] = Σ_i w_i · I[∀k: s_{i,j,k} ≥ t_k]  (size M) OR compute from counts_pass if you also store per-agent masks\n  Update when agent i changes scores for alternative j': recompute that agent’s pass vector for the affected j' and update relevant counts in O(K) time.\n- For L_infty shortfall:\n  - sum_shortfall[j] = Σ_i w_i · d_{i,j}  (size M)\n  - If agent i changes, compute new d_{i,j'} and update sum_shortfall[j'] in O(K).\n- For lexicographic:\n  - histogram depth_counts[j, d] = Σ_i w_i · I[d_{i,j} = d] (size M×(K+1)). Update O(K) per change.\n\nPer-update complexity\n- If a single agent updates one alternative: O(K).\n- If a single agent updates all M alternatives: O(M·K) (still small for M≈20, K≈5).\n- If you cannot store N×M full data due to memory you must persist a mapping of agent→(j,k) entries updated and store per-agent per-alternative mask/shortfall for incremental updates.\n\nHandling churn\n- When agent leaves: subtract their weighted contributions from maintained summaries. When new agent arrives: add contributions.\n- If many agents join/leave in batch, process as batch updates to leverage vectorized ops.\n\nRobust incremental algorithms to aim for sublinear in N\n- Maintain counts/sums as above so single-agent updates do not touch all N.\n- For global reparameterization (changing thresholds t_k), you must recompute from raw S or maintain approximate quantile summaries per (j,k) to re-evaluate thresholds efficiently.\n\nImplementation guidance and practicalities\n- Data layout: store S as dense N×M×K if N*M*K small (≈100×20×5=10k scalars → trivial). Use NumPy arrays for vectorized computations; pandas for tabular access.\n- Maintain per-alternative aggregates as small arrays (M×K counts, M sums) for O(1) reads and O(K) updates.\n- Libraries: NumPy, pandas, Numba for speed-critical loops, SciPy/statsmodels for tests; sklearn for clustering if needed.\n- Missing values: use masked arrays (numpy.ma) or NaNs; handle masks carefully in vectorized ops.\n\nSmall synthetic experiment plan to compare metrics\nGoals: measure discriminative power, stability (sensitivity to noise), runtime.\n\nGenerate populations\n- Base model: create C clusters (C ∈ {1,2,3}) representing coalitions. For cluster c generate cluster mean µ_{c,k} for each criterion from Beta(a,b) tuned to produce desired separations. For each agent i in cluster c, sample s_{i,j,k} ~ Beta(α=µ_{c,k}·γ, β=(1-µ_{c,k})·γ) where γ controls spread (higher γ close to cluster mean). Vary γ to control within-cluster agreement.\n- Alternatives: for M alternatives specify alternative-level offsets o_{j,k} to shift cluster means: µ_{c,k,j} = µ_{c,k} + o_{j,k} then clip to [0,1]. Use some alternatives that are universally good (o positive across clusters) and some divisive (good for only some clusters).\n- Noise: add random noise or inject adversarial agents with flipped scores.\n- Missingness: randomly drop p_missing fraction of entries.\n\nEvaluation protocol\n- For each synthetic dataset, compute A_j for each metric.\n- Discriminative power: correlate metric rank with “ground truth” acceptability (e.g., fraction of clusters with µ_{c} above t, or known true label). Compute AUC for detecting acceptable alternatives.\n- Stability: bootstrap agents (resample) 1000 times, compute CI width of A_j. Stability = average CI width.\n- Robustness: inject x% adversarial agents and measure change in A_j (influence).\n- Runtime: measure compute time for full recompute and per-agent incremental update.\n- Sweep hyperparameters (t_k, v_k, α) and report sensitivity plots.\n\nDesign choices that require clarification (summary)\n- Cardinal vs ordinal scores: do you want metrics that respect magnitudes (shortfall, L∞) or only orders (lexicographic, outranking)? My defaults assume cardinal.\n- Per‑alternative vs global consensus metric: I default to per‑alternative but can provide an across-alternative summary (e.g., mean_j A_j or fraction of alternatives with A_j ≥ τ).\n- Meaning of non‑compensatory: strict conjunctive (all criteria must pass), lexicographic, or “limited compensation” via L∞? I proposed all three families; pick one or combine (e.g., veto + shortfall).\n- Agent weights and cluster structure: do we have weights or should equal weights be assumed?\n- Latency per update: this defines whether you must optimize further (e.g., use approximate counters, quantile summaries).\n\nRecommended defaults (practical)\n- Use per‑alternative consensus A_j.\n- Use weighted counts with equal weights by default.\n- Use two metrics in parallel:\n  - Conjunctive threshold (A_j^conj) for interpretability and strict non‑compensation.\n  - Max‑shortfall (A_j^Linf) for continuous graded non‑compensation.\n- Decision rule: shortlist alternatives with A_j^conj ≥ 0.5 (majority pass all criteria) or A_j^Linf ≥ 0.7 and then break ties by average utility.\n- Maintain per-alternative counts_pass and sum_shortfall for O(K) updates per agent change.\n\nIf you want, I can now:\n- (A) Produce ready-to-run pseudocode in Python (NumPy) for each metric plus incremental update functions and unit tests, or\n- (B) Tailor thresholds, criterion ordering, and hyperparameter defaults to your domain if you tell me a bit about which criteria are critical and whether weights exist.\n\nWhich would you prefer?"
