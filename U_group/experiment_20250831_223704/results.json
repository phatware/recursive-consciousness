You want analysis of how this non‑compensatory unanimous threshold affects existence/uniqueness/stability/fairness/representativeness of the surviving alternatives under heterogeneous/conflicting preferences, and how network connectivity (sparsity, diameter, neighborhood structure) and communication constraints impact convergence speed, resilience to partial information, and the representativeness of the emergent group decision.",
