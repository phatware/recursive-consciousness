    "[A2 Question]: Should the reference vector s be fixed and globally known to all agents (i.e., everyone aims for the same known s), or should s be unknown and the agents must infer or estimate it from data (e.g., via distributed estimation or external signals)?",
    "[A1 Answer]: Answer: Fix s and make it globally known to all agents.\n\nReasoning:\n- Having a fixed, known reference provides a well-defined target for the non-compensatory metrics M_NC and enables straightforward ε-consensus definitions (errors are measured relative to the same s for all agents and coordinates).\n- It simplifies analysis: convergence/robustness results, online computation of M_NC, and comparisons with standard consensus metrics become tractable when the target is common and known.\n- It avoids identifiability issues that arise if s must be inferred while also tracking x_i(t).\n\nOptional note (if you want unknown s in a future extension):\n- You can extend the framework to joint estimation of s and x_i(t) (distributed estimation of s) and redefine M_NC to use ŝ(t) (the agents’ estimates of s) in place of s. This couples consensus with a parameter-estimation problem and increases complexity, but is feasible with additional assumptions (e.g., persistent excitation, shared observation models, or a dedicated observer/consensus layer for s).",
    "[A3 Question]: Do you want the analysis and M_NC formulations to assume strictly synchronous update steps (all agents update in lockstep at each t), or should I design the framework to handle asynchronous updates with communication delays as well?",
    "[A1 Answer]: Answer: Design the framework to handle asynchronous updates with bounded communication delays (i.e., allow asynchrony and delays as the default). The strictly synchronous case can be treated as a special case (zero delays and synchronized updates) for intuition and initial analysis.\n\nRationale (brief):\n- Real networks are inherently asynchronous due to computation times, scheduling, and communication delays. Designing for asynchrony makes M_NC applicable in practice.\n- Bounded-delay asynchronous models (e.g., joint connectivity over time windows, delayed reads, and eventual updates) are standard in modern consensus theory and enable meaningful convergence/robustness results.\n- Having asynchronous capability also simplifies handling directed graphs, time-varying topologies, and potential mis-timings across agents.\n\nIf you want, I can also outline a concrete asynchronous update model (with delays and time-stamped communications) and show how M_NC can be computed online under that model, with synchronous as a special-case reduction.",
    "[A4 Question]: Should the non-compensatory metric M_NC be defined and computed using only the instantaneous states x_i(t) at time t, or should it be defined over a sliding time window [t−T, t] (i.e., M_NC(t) = f({x_i(τ) for τ ∈ [t−T, t]})) to incorporate history/dynamics?",
    "[A1 Answer]: Answer: Use a sliding time window [t−T, t] to define M_NC. That is, evaluate the non-compensatory metric on the history of states over a horizon T, not just on the instantaneous state at time t. This captures persistent deviations, filters out transient noise, and yields a meaningful notion of ε-consensus under non-compensatory criteria. The windowed definition can be made online with FIFO buffers or running maxima, and T can be tuned to the network’s mixing/consensus time. Note that T = 0 reduces to the instantaneous case as a special, less robust variant.\n\nThree concrete windowed forms (well-defined and computable online)\n\n1) Windowed max-deviation (strongest non-compensation)\n- Definition: For t ≥ 0,\n  M_NC^W1(t) = max over i in {1..N}, j in {1..d}, τ in [t−T, t] of |x_i^j(τ) − s^j|.\n  Equivalently, M_NC^W1(t) = max_i max_j max_{τ∈[t−T,t]} |x_i^j(τ) − s^j|.\n- ε-consensus: M_NC^W1(t) ≤ ε.\n- Commentary: A single large deviation in any coordinate for any agent within the window drives the metric up, ensuring non-compensation across coordinates and time.\n- Online computability: Maintain for each (i, j) the running maximum of |x_i^j(τ) − s^j| over the window; take the global max across i, j. With a sliding window, you can implement this with per-track buffers and a deque to drop the oldest sample.\n\n2) Windowed per-coordinate non-compensation via tolerance and time-coverage\n- Setup: Pick coordinate tolerances δ_j > 0 for j = 1..d.\n- For each τ, define p_j(τ) = (1/N) ∑_{i=1}^N 1{ |x_i^j(τ) − s^j| ≤ δ_j } (the fraction of agents within tolerance for coordinate j at time τ).\n- Definition: M_NC^W2(t) = max_{j=1..d} [ 1 − min_{τ∈[t−T,t]} p_j(τ) ].\n- ε-consensus: M_NC^W2(t) ≤ ε.\n- Commentary: A coordinate is “non-consensual” if, at some time in the window, too few agents stay within the per-coordinate tolerance δ_j. The max over coordinates enforces non-compensation across coordinates in time.\n- Online computability: For each τ in the window, compute p_j(τ) from the current x_i^j(τ); maintain the minimum p_j over the window for all j; M_NC^W2(t) is the maximum of 1 − min p_j across coordinates.\n\n3) Windowed lexicographic/non-compensatory with priority among coordinates\n- Assume a fixed importance order of coordinates π(1), π(2), ..., π(d).\n- For each k = 1..d, define e_k^* = max_{τ∈[t−T,t]} max_i |x_i^{π(k)}(τ) − s^{π(k)}|.\n- Define a lexicographic non-compensation score:\n  - Let k* be the smallest index k for which e_k^* > δ_{π(k)}; if none, set M_NC^W3(t) = 0.\n  - Otherwise, M_NC^W3(t) = e_{k*}^* (the first-most-important coordinate that violates its tolerance, with magnitude of its worst deviation).\n- ε-consensus: M_NC^W3(t) ≤ ε.\n- Commentary: Higher-priority coordinates dominate the metric; deviations in more important coordinates cannot be “compensated” by better performance in less important ones.\n- Online computability: Maintain e_k^* as the maximum deviation for each coordinate in the window; identify the first coordinate whose e_k^* exceeds its δ and report its value.\n\nNotes and practical guidance\n\n- Why a window is preferable: In non-compensatory design, a single large error in any coordinate should degrade consensus regardless of other coordinates. Playing out over a window reduces sensitivity to transient noise, faults, or brief misalignments and focuses on sustained disagreement that matters for real deployments.\n- Tuning and interpretation:\n  - T should be chosen on the time-scale of the network’s convergence (mixing) time and the expected dynamics of x_i(t). If T is too small, you resemble instantaneous metrics; if too large, you may over-smooth and delay detection of issues.\n  - δ_j (for Form 2 and 3) and the priority order π should reflect domain importance; you can fix them a priori or adapt them if you have domain knowledge.\n- Special case: T = 0 yields the instantaneous M_NC forms as a special case (no history). In practice, handing a nonzero T is recommended for robustness.\n- Relationship to standard consensus notions: If M_NC^W1 ≤ ε for a small ε, then all coordinates of all agents stayed within ε of s across the whole window; this implies a strong form of ε-consensus that is robust to short-lived deviations.\n- Computational considerations:\n  - Form 1: O(Nd) time per step, O(Nd) memory for the windowed maxima (plus buffers to drop old samples).\n  - Form 2: O(Nd) time per step to compute p_j(τ) across the window if you maintain per-τ statistics; can be optimized with incremental counts and sliding windows.\n  - Form 3: O(Nd) time per step to update e_k^* for each coordinate; requires maintaining per-coordinate maxima over the window.\n\nSummary answer\n- Use a sliding window [t−T, t] to define M_NC. It provides a robust, online, non-compensatory measure that accounts for history and is adaptable to asynchronous, time-varying dynamics.\n- The three concrete windowed forms above give explicit, implementable definitions with clear ε-consensus criteria.\n- If you want a purely instantaneous version later, you can treat T = 0 as a special case, but the windowed definitions are the recommended default for practical non-compensatory consensus evaluation.",
    "[A2 Question]: Should the sliding window length T be a fixed, globally shared parameter (the same T for all agents and coordinates), or would you prefer an adaptive, time-varying T (potentially different per coordinate or agent) to reflect changing consensus time scales?",
    "[A1 Answer]: Answer: Use adaptive, time-varying window lengths per coordinate (T_j(t)), with a simple, bounded update rule. This best reflects changing consensus time scales across coordinates and agents, improves robustness to noise and transient disturbances, and keeps online computability.\n\nRationale (brief):\n- Different coordinates can converge at different rates; a fixed global T may be too small for some and too large for others.\n- An adaptive T_j(t) tracks the current mixing/consensus time scale, reducing false alarms from short-lived fluctuations and preserving responsiveness during fast convergence.\n- Per-coordinate adaptation is straightforward to implement and can be bounded to maintain online computability.\n\nProposed adaptive scheme (per-coordinate T_j(t)):\n- Notation: For each coordinate j ∈ {1, …, d}, maintain a window length T_j(t) ∈ [T_min, T_max], with T_min and T_max chosen a priori. Initialize T_j(0) = T_min.\n- Per time t, compute:\n  - D_j(t) = max_i |x_i^j(t) − s^j| (worst deviation across agents for coordinate j).\n  - ε_j is the per-coordinate tolerance (can be uniform or chosen per domain).\n  - Bad indicator: B_j(t) = 1 if D_j(t) > ε_j, else B_j(t) = 0.\n- Maintain a simple streak counter:\n  - streak_j(t) = (streak_j(t−1) + 1) if B_j(t) = 1, else 0.\n- Update rule (discrete steps, with small increments):\n  - If streak_j(t) ≥ S_up, then T_j(t+1) = min(T_max, T_j(t) + Δ).\n  - Else if streak_j(t) = 0 for K_down consecutive steps, then T_j(t+1) = max(T_min, T_j(t) − Δ).\n  - Otherwise, T_j(t+1) = T_j(t).\n- Parameters to pick:\n  - T_min and T_max: e.g., T_min = 5 samples, T_max = 200 samples (adjust to the network’s sampling rate and mixing time).\n  - Δ: a small step, e.g., Δ = 1 (in samples).\n  - S_up: e.g., 3–5 consecutive steps with D_j(t) > ε_j before increasing T.\n  - K_down: e.g., 5–10 consecutive steps with D_j(t) ≤ ε_j before decreasing T.\n- Optional simplifications:\n  - If desired, share a common baseline: compute T_common(t) using the aggregate of all coordinates (e.g., average of T_j(t)) and apply it to all coordinates, plus a small per-coordinate jitter. This reduces bookkeeping while still adapting to overall dynamics.\n  - Alternatively, fix a single global T_min ≤ T ≤ T_max as a fallback if implementation simplicity is paramount.\n\nOnline computability and storage:\n- Each coordinate requires only:\n  - O(1) memory for D_j(t), ε_j, B_j(t), streak_j(t), and T_j(t).\n  - O(1) computation per time step per coordinate to update D_j(t) and T_j(t).\n- Overall complexity remains O(Nd) per time step for computing D_j(t) plus O(d) for the window adaptation.\n\nFallback option:\n- If you prefer to keep things simple, you can start with a fixed global T (the same T across all coordinates) and switch to the adaptive scheme if empirical results show persistent misalignment or sensitivity to noise.\n\nBottom line:\n- Adopt adaptive, per-coordinate window lengths T_j(t) with bounded limits and a simple, event-driven update rule. This provides a practical balance between responsiveness and robustness, while preserving the non-compensatory nature of M_NC. If you later need a simpler baseline, you can operate with a fixed T as a special case.",
    "[A3 Question]: What is the maximum number of Byzantine/malicious agents you want to tolerate, and should the M_NC definitions incorporate Byzantine-robust mechanisms (e.g., trimmed/median-of-means, MSR-type filtering) or assume all agents are benign with bounded noise?",
    "[A1 Answer]: Short answer\n\n- Maximum tolerated Byzantine/malicious agents: f = ⌊(N − 1) / 3⌋. In other words, you can tolerate up to f Byzantine agents provided N ≥ 3f + 1 (and the usual connectivity conditions described below).\n- Should M_NC incorporate Byzantine-robust mechanisms? Yes. Use Byzantine-robust aggregation (MSR-type, trimmed-mean, median-of-means, Krum/Bulyan variants, etc.) inside the update rule so that non-faulty agents drive the group toward the reference despite up to f adversaries.\n\nConcrete guidance and minimal assumptions\n\n- Fault tolerance bound\n  - Let f be the maximum number of Byzantine agents to tolerate. Require N ≥ 3f + 1.\n  - In directed/time-varying graphs, strengthen with a windowed connectivity assumption: over every time window of length T_w, the union of the graphs is strongly connected and each non-faulty node has at least 2f + 1 in-neighbors within that window (i.e., an f-resilient condition). This mirrors standard MSR-type results for time-varying directed graphs.\n\n- Byzantine-robust update (practical implementation)\n  - Each non-faulty agent i collects neighbor states x_k(t) from in-neighbors at time t (allowing delays; see note on asynchronous extensions below).\n  - Apply a robust aggregation on each coordinate or on the whole vector:\n    - MSR-like rule: discard the f largest and f smallest values for each coordinate (or for the entire vector using a suitable distance-based ordering), then average the remaining values.\n    - Alternatives (if you prefer): trimmed-mean per coordinate, median-of-means, or a robust consensus variant such as Krum/Bulyan (with per-step computational caveats).\n  - Update form (synchronous baseline): x_i(t+1) = w_ii x_i(t) + sum_{k ∈ N_i^−(t)} w_{ik} x_k(t), where the weights are derived from the robust-aggregation of the in-neighbors after trimming. With asynchronous delays, use time stamps and bound delays to keep updates consistent.\n  - Reference to s: all honest agents aim toward the fixed, known s. The robust-aggregated input is still driven toward s as long as non-faulty inputs concentrate around s.\n\n- Non-compensatory M_NC with robustness\n  - Define M_NC^robust(t) using the state that results from the robust aggregation step (i.e., using the post-robust-update states, or the robust-aggregated neighbor input that feeds each x_i(t+1)).\n  - The non-compensatory nature is preserved: a large deviation in any coordinate by up to f Byzantine peers will be attenuated by the trimming/robust step, but a persistent large deviation by ≥ f adversaries can still prevent exact agreement. The metric M_NC^robust(t) should be evaluated on the robust-consensus trajectory.\n  - ε-consensus under M_NC^robust: M_NC^robust(t) ≤ ε for a target ε that depends on the noise bounds (if any), the robustness properties of the aggregator, and the update gain.\n\n- Practical design notes\n  - Required load and topology: each node should have in-degree ≥ 2f + 1 in every relevant window, and the time-varying graph must be jointly connected over windows of length T_w. This ensures that after trimming f outliers on each coordinate, at least f+1 non-faulty values remain to influence each coordinate.\n  - Complexity: per-step complexity is O(deg_in(i) log deg_in(i)) if you sort to trim f largest/smallest; with optimizations you can do partial selection in O(deg_in(i)) time. Memory scales with the number of tracked neighbors and the dimension d.\n  - Asynchrony and delays: the MSR-type approach extends to asynchronous models with bounded delays under analogous connectivity assumptions, but you typically need a stronger in-degree condition and a bound on the maximum delay to guarantee similar convergence properties.\n  - Robustness vs performance trade-off: increasing f reduces the speed of convergence and can increase the steady-state error in the presence of noise. Choose f = ⌊(N − 1)/3⌋ as a safe maximum; if you know fewer adversaries will appear, you can conservatively set f lower to improve performance.\n\nWhat this means for your Q&A\n- Answer: Tolerate up to f = ⌊(N − 1)/3⌋ Byzantine agents. Yes, define M_NC in a Byzantine-robust way (MSR-type or other robust aggregators) and evaluate M_NC on the trajectory produced by the robust update. This combination provides concrete, provable guarantees under the standard assumptions (N ≥ 3f+1, sufficient in-degree, joint connectivity over time windows) and yields a meaningful ε-consensus notion for the non-compensatory metric in the presence of adversaries.",
    "[A4 Question]: Should M_NC be defined and computed in a fully distributed online manner (with no central aggregator and only local communications), or is it acceptable to use a central coordinator to compute M_NC from all agents’ states (online or offline)?",
    "[A1 Answer]: Short answer: Define and compute M_NC in a fully distributed online manner. A central coordinator should not be required (and is not ideal) for deployment, though a centralizer can be used as a baseline or for offline evaluation.\n\nDetails and rationale\n\n- Why distributed online is preferred\n  - Alignment with the consensus setting: the whole point of the framework is to reason about what the network of agents can agree on using only local communication.\n  - Scalability and robustness: no single point of failure or bottleneck. Works with asynchronous updates, time-varying directed graphs, and bounded delays.\n  - Privacy and practicality: agents keep their own states locally; no need to send everything to a central node.\n  - Real-time operation: online computation via local data and neighbor communications yields immediate M_NC values without waiting for a central pass.\n\n- When a central coordinator might be acceptable\n  - Small-scale experiments or offline validation where latency is not critical.\n  - Environments where a trusted central entity already exists and routing overhead is negligible.\n  - Use as a baseline to validate distributed implementations, not as the production mechanism.\n\nHow to implement M_NC in a distributed online fashion (high level)\n\nAssume you keep the same windowed definitions you proposed, e.g., M_NC^W1, M_NC^W2, M_NC^W3, but compute them via distributed consensus protocols rather than a central collector.\n\nKey building blocks you can implement locally\n\n1) Windowed max-deviation (M_NC^W1)\n- Local per-agent local window values: each agent i maintains D_i^j(τ) = |x_i^j(τ) − s^j| for τ ∈ [t−T, t].\n- Each agent stores U_i^j(t) = max_{τ∈[t−T,t]} D_i^j(τ).\n- Distributed max over i: run a fault-tolerant max-consensus (or simple flooding/weighted averaging with max operation) across the in-neighborhood to converge to M^j(t) = max_i U_i^j(t).\n- Global metric: M_NC^W1(t) = max_j M^j(t). This can be obtained by a small number of rounds of per-coordinate max-consensus circulating among neighbors.\n- Online computability: O(1) per-step per coordinate after you update the local D_i^j(t) and the window max.\n\n2) Windowed per-coordinate non-compensation via tolerance and time-coverage (M_NC^W2)\n- For each time τ, each agent i computes h_i^j(τ) = 1{ |x_i^j(τ) − s^j| ≤ δ_j }.\n- Each agent can locally contribute to the group p_j(τ) = (1/N) ∑_i h_i^j(τ). To avoid central gathering, perform a distributed average consensus on h_i^j(τ) in time τ to get a local estimate of p_j(τ) across the network. In practice, you run a few rounds of average-consensus on the vector {h_i^j(τ)} to converge to p_j(τ) at each τ.\n- Maintain the windowed minimum of p_j(τ) over τ ∈ [t−T, t], i.e., p_j,min(t) = min_{τ∈[t−T,t]} p_j(τ).\n- Compute M_NC^W2(t) = max_j [1 − p_j,min(t)] using another distributed max across coordinates.\n- Online computability: each τ you perform a small consensus for that τ, update the running min per coordinate, and then take a max across coordinates.\n\n3) Windowed lexicographic non-compensation (M_NC^W3)\n- Maintain per-coordinate window maxima e_k^*(t) = max_{τ∈[t−T,t]} |x_i^{π(k)}(τ) − s^{π(k)}| for the most important coordinate π(k) across all agents i (or have each agent contribute its own window max and then fuse via max-consensus).\n- Identify k* = the smallest index with e_k^*(t) > δ_{π(k)}. Set M_NC^W3(t) = e_{k*}^*(t) (or 0 if none exceed).\n- Implementation: run per-coordinate max-consensus for each k to compute e_k^*(t) in distributed fashion, then a simple coordinate-wise comparison to pick the first violating coordinate.\n\nNotes on asynchronous updates and delays\n- The above schemes are compatible with asynchronous operation and bounded delays. Use time-stamping and conservative buffering to ensure that contributions from past timestamps are not retroactively double-counted.\n- A typical assumption: joint connectivity over time windows (the union of graphs over a window is strongly connected) and bounded delays. With these, standard distributed max/average consensus tools guarantee convergence to the correct windowed M_NC values or accurate approximations within a small error.\n\nRobustness (Byzantine/adversarial agents)\n- If you need Byzantine resilience, incorporate robust aggregation in the local consensus steps:\n  - For max-like forms (W1, W3), you can use MSR/Krum-type selectors coordinate-wise before the max/aggregation step.\n  - For average-like steps (W2), use trimmed-mean or median-of-means aggregations per τ, per coordinate, before updating p_j(τ).\n- The same f-outlier tolerances and in-degree requirements apply as in the central setting, e.g., tolerate up to f Byzantine agents with N ≥ 3f+1 in appropriate directed-time-varying-graph conditions.\n\nWhat to report and how to implement in practice\n- Online protocol outline:\n  - Each agent stores local x_i(t), the reference s, buffers for the window [t−T, t], and auxiliary statistics for the chosen M_NC form.\n  - At each iteration, exchange relevant local summaries with neighbors (e.g., U_i^j(t), h_i^j(t), or per-coordinate window maxima).\n  - Run a small number of gossip/max-consensus rounds to fuse into global M^j(t) values or p_j,min(t), etc.\n  - Compute M_NC(t) according to the current windowed form (W1, W2, or W3) from the fused values.\n  - Use M_NC(t) to guide monitoring, triggering faults or replanning if M_NC(t) exceeds a threshold ε.\n- Computational and communication costs\n  - Per-step work is O(d * deg_in(i)) for each agent i, with constant-factor overhead for the number of consensus rounds per time step.\n  - Memory scales with the chosen window length T and the per-coordinate statistics (O(dT) per agent, but you can implement with running maxima/minima to keep it near O(d)).\n- Central coordinator caveat\n  - A central aggregator can compute M_NC consistently and with minimal local computation, but it defeats the distributed robustness, introduces a single point of failure, and may incur additional latency. It can be used as an offline evaluator or a debugging baseline but is not recommended as the production mechanism.\n\nBottom line\n- M_NC should be defined and computed in a fully distributed online manner, using local data and neighbor communications, with windowed formulations to capture persistent non-compensation and to tolerate noise.\n- A central coordinator can be used only as a baseline/evaluation tool, not as the primary mechanism for real-time operation in a distributed network.",
    "[A2 Question]: Which of the three windowed non-compensatory forms (M_NC^W1: windowed max deviation; M_NC^W2: per-coordinate threshold/coverage; M_NC^W3: lexicographic/priority) would you like me to develop and prove first?",
    "[A1 Answer]: Answer: Develop and prove M_NC^W1 (windowed max deviation) first.\n\nReason:\n- It embodies the strongest non-compensation: a single large deviation in any agent, coordinate, or time within the window drives the metric up, which gives a clear, interpretable ε-consensus target (M_NC^W1(t) ≤ ε).\n- It is the simplest to define and compute online: you keep a per-(i,j) running max over the window [t−T,t], then take a global max across i, j. This yields a natural, conservative robustness guarantee.\n- It generalizes directly to asynchronous/delay-tolerant settings with a sliding window and standard consensus mixing assumptions, and provides a clean baseline against which the other, more nuanced forms (W2, W3) can be compared.\n\nIf you want, I can start by delivering the precise mathematical definition, ε-consensus criterion, and a sketch of convergence/robustness results for M_NC^W1, then proceed to M_NC^W2 and M_NC^W3 in follow-ups. If you’d prefer a different starting form, tell me (W2 or W3) and I’ll adapt."

    "answers": [
      "Answer: Fix s and make it globally known to all agents.\n\nReasoning:\n- Having a fixed, known reference provides a well-defined target for the non-compensatory metrics M_NC and enables straightforward ε-consensus definitions (errors are measured relative to the same s for all agents and coordinates).\n- It simplifies analysis: convergence/robustness results, online computation of M_NC, and comparisons with standard consensus metrics become tractable when the target is common and known.\n- It avoids identifiability issues that arise if s must be inferred while also tracking x_i(t).\n\nOptional note (if you want unknown s in a future extension):\n- You can extend the framework to joint estimation of s and x_i(t) (distributed estimation of s) and redefine M_NC to use ŝ(t) (the agents’ estimates of s) in place of s. This couples consensus with a parameter-estimation problem and increases complexity, but is feasible with additional assumptions (e.g., persistent excitation, shared observation models, or a dedicated observer/consensus layer for s).",
      "Answer: Design the framework to handle asynchronous updates with bounded communication delays (i.e., allow asynchrony and delays as the default). The strictly synchronous case can be treated as a special case (zero delays and synchronized updates) for intuition and initial analysis.\n\nRationale (brief):\n- Real networks are inherently asynchronous due to computation times, scheduling, and communication delays. Designing for asynchrony makes M_NC applicable in practice.\n- Bounded-delay asynchronous models (e.g., joint connectivity over time windows, delayed reads, and eventual updates) are standard in modern consensus theory and enable meaningful convergence/robustness results.\n- Having asynchronous capability also simplifies handling directed graphs, time-varying topologies, and potential mis-timings across agents.\n\nIf you want, I can also outline a concrete asynchronous update model (with delays and time-stamped communications) and show how M_NC can be computed online under that model, with synchronous as a special-case reduction.",
      "Answer: Use a sliding time window [t−T, t] to define M_NC. That is, evaluate the non-compensatory metric on the history of states over a horizon T, not just on the instantaneous state at time t. This captures persistent deviations, filters out transient noise, and yields a meaningful notion of ε-consensus under non-compensatory criteria. The windowed definition can be made online with FIFO buffers or running maxima, and T can be tuned to the network’s mixing/consensus time. Note that T = 0 reduces to the instantaneous case as a special, less robust variant.\n\nThree concrete windowed forms (well-defined and computable online)\n\n1) Windowed max-deviation (strongest non-compensation)\n- Definition: For t ≥ 0,\n  M_NC^W1(t) = max over i in {1..N}, j in {1..d}, τ in [t−T, t] of |x_i^j(τ) − s^j|.\n  Equivalently, M_NC^W1(t) = max_i max_j max_{τ∈[t−T,t]} |x_i^j(τ) − s^j|.\n- ε-consensus: M_NC^W1(t) ≤ ε.\n- Commentary: A single large deviation in any coordinate for any agent within the window drives the metric up, ensuring non-compensation across coordinates and time.\n- Online computability: Maintain for each (i, j) the running maximum of |x_i^j(τ) − s^j| over the window; take the global max across i, j. With a sliding window, you can implement this with per-track buffers and a deque to drop the oldest sample.\n\n2) Windowed per-coordinate non-compensation via tolerance and time-coverage\n- Setup: Pick coordinate tolerances δ_j > 0 for j = 1..d.\n- For each τ, define p_j(τ) = (1/N) ∑_{i=1}^N 1{ |x_i^j(τ) − s^j| ≤ δ_j } (the fraction of agents within tolerance for coordinate j at time τ).\n- Definition: M_NC^W2(t) = max_{j=1..d} [ 1 − min_{τ∈[t−T,t]} p_j(τ) ].\n- ε-consensus: M_NC^W2(t) ≤ ε.\n- Commentary: A coordinate is “non-consensual” if, at some time in the window, too few agents stay within the per-coordinate tolerance δ_j. The max over coordinates enforces non-compensation across coordinates in time.\n- Online computability: For each τ in the window, compute p_j(τ) from the current x_i^j(τ); maintain the minimum p_j over the window for all j; M_NC^W2(t) is the maximum of 1 − min p_j across coordinates.\n\n3) Windowed lexicographic/non-compensatory with priority among coordinates\n- Assume a fixed importance order of coordinates π(1), π(2), ..., π(d).\n- For each k = 1..d, define e_k^* = max_{τ∈[t−T,t]} max_i |x_i^{π(k)}(τ) − s^{π(k)}|.\n- Define a lexicographic non-compensation score:\n  - Let k* be the smallest index k for which e_k^* > δ_{π(k)}; if none, set M_NC^W3(t) = 0.\n  - Otherwise, M_NC^W3(t) = e_{k*}^* (the first-most-important coordinate that violates its tolerance, with magnitude of its worst deviation).\n- ε-consensus: M_NC^W3(t) ≤ ε.\n- Commentary: Higher-priority coordinates dominate the metric; deviations in more important coordinates cannot be “compensated” by better performance in less important ones.\n- Online computability: Maintain e_k^* as the maximum deviation for each coordinate in the window; identify the first coordinate whose e_k^* exceeds its δ and report its value.\n\nNotes and practical guidance\n\n- Why a window is preferable: In non-compensatory design, a single large error in any coordinate should degrade consensus regardless of other coordinates. Playing out over a window reduces sensitivity to transient noise, faults, or brief misalignments and focuses on sustained disagreement that matters for real deployments.\n- Tuning and interpretation:\n  - T should be chosen on the time-scale of the network’s convergence (mixing) time and the expected dynamics of x_i(t). If T is too small, you resemble instantaneous metrics; if too large, you may over-smooth and delay detection of issues.\n  - δ_j (for Form 2 and 3) and the priority order π should reflect domain importance; you can fix them a priori or adapt them if you have domain knowledge.\n- Special case: T = 0 yields the instantaneous M_NC forms as a special case (no history). In practice, handing a nonzero T is recommended for robustness.\n- Relationship to standard consensus notions: If M_NC^W1 ≤ ε for a small ε, then all coordinates of all agents stayed within ε of s across the whole window; this implies a strong form of ε-consensus that is robust to short-lived deviations.\n- Computational considerations:\n  - Form 1: O(Nd) time per step, O(Nd) memory for the windowed maxima (plus buffers to drop old samples).\n  - Form 2: O(Nd) time per step to compute p_j(τ) across the window if you maintain per-τ statistics; can be optimized with incremental counts and sliding windows.\n  - Form 3: O(Nd) time per step to update e_k^* for each coordinate; requires maintaining per-coordinate maxima over the window.\n\nSummary answer\n- Use a sliding window [t−T, t] to define M_NC. It provides a robust, online, non-compensatory measure that accounts for history and is adaptable to asynchronous, time-varying dynamics.\n- The three concrete windowed forms above give explicit, implementable definitions with clear ε-consensus criteria.\n- If you want a purely instantaneous version later, you can treat T = 0 as a special case, but the windowed definitions are the recommended default for practical non-compensatory consensus evaluation.",
      "Answer: Use adaptive, time-varying window lengths per coordinate (T_j(t)), with a simple, bounded update rule. This best reflects changing consensus time scales across coordinates and agents, improves robustness to noise and transient disturbances, and keeps online computability.\n\nRationale (brief):\n- Different coordinates can converge at different rates; a fixed global T may be too small for some and too large for others.\n- An adaptive T_j(t) tracks the current mixing/consensus time scale, reducing false alarms from short-lived fluctuations and preserving responsiveness during fast convergence.\n- Per-coordinate adaptation is straightforward to implement and can be bounded to maintain online computability.\n\nProposed adaptive scheme (per-coordinate T_j(t)):\n- Notation: For each coordinate j ∈ {1, …, d}, maintain a window length T_j(t) ∈ [T_min, T_max], with T_min and T_max chosen a priori. Initialize T_j(0) = T_min.\n- Per time t, compute:\n  - D_j(t) = max_i |x_i^j(t) − s^j| (worst deviation across agents for coordinate j).\n  - ε_j is the per-coordinate tolerance (can be uniform or chosen per domain).\n  - Bad indicator: B_j(t) = 1 if D_j(t) > ε_j, else B_j(t) = 0.\n- Maintain a simple streak counter:\n  - streak_j(t) = (streak_j(t−1) + 1) if B_j(t) = 1, else 0.\n- Update rule (discrete steps, with small increments):\n  - If streak_j(t) ≥ S_up, then T_j(t+1) = min(T_max, T_j(t) + Δ).\n  - Else if streak_j(t) = 0 for K_down consecutive steps, then T_j(t+1) = max(T_min, T_j(t) − Δ).\n  - Otherwise, T_j(t+1) = T_j(t).\n- Parameters to pick:\n  - T_min and T_max: e.g., T_min = 5 samples, T_max = 200 samples (adjust to the network’s sampling rate and mixing time).\n  - Δ: a small step, e.g., Δ = 1 (in samples).\n  - S_up: e.g., 3–5 consecutive steps with D_j(t) > ε_j before increasing T.\n  - K_down: e.g., 5–10 consecutive steps with D_j(t) ≤ ε_j before decreasing T.\n- Optional simplifications:\n  - If desired, share a common baseline: compute T_common(t) using the aggregate of all coordinates (e.g., average of T_j(t)) and apply it to all coordinates, plus a small per-coordinate jitter. This reduces bookkeeping while still adapting to overall dynamics.\n  - Alternatively, fix a single global T_min ≤ T ≤ T_max as a fallback if implementation simplicity is paramount.\n\nOnline computability and storage:\n- Each coordinate requires only:\n  - O(1) memory for D_j(t), ε_j, B_j(t), streak_j(t), and T_j(t).\n  - O(1) computation per time step per coordinate to update D_j(t) and T_j(t).\n- Overall complexity remains O(Nd) per time step for computing D_j(t) plus O(d) for the window adaptation.\n\nFallback option:\n- If you prefer to keep things simple, you can start with a fixed global T (the same T across all coordinates) and switch to the adaptive scheme if empirical results show persistent misalignment or sensitivity to noise.\n\nBottom line:\n- Adopt adaptive, per-coordinate window lengths T_j(t) with bounded limits and a simple, event-driven update rule. This provides a practical balance between responsiveness and robustness, while preserving the non-compensatory nature of M_NC. If you later need a simpler baseline, you can operate with a fixed T as a special case.",
      "Short answer\n\n- Maximum tolerated Byzantine/malicious agents: f = ⌊(N − 1) / 3⌋. In other words, you can tolerate up to f Byzantine agents provided N ≥ 3f + 1 (and the usual connectivity conditions described below).\n- Should M_NC incorporate Byzantine-robust mechanisms? Yes. Use Byzantine-robust aggregation (MSR-type, trimmed-mean, median-of-means, Krum/Bulyan variants, etc.) inside the update rule so that non-faulty agents drive the group toward the reference despite up to f adversaries.\n\nConcrete guidance and minimal assumptions\n\n- Fault tolerance bound\n  - Let f be the maximum number of Byzantine agents to tolerate. Require N ≥ 3f + 1.\n  - In directed/time-varying graphs, strengthen with a windowed connectivity assumption: over every time window of length T_w, the union of the graphs is strongly connected and each non-faulty node has at least 2f + 1 in-neighbors within that window (i.e., an f-resilient condition). This mirrors standard MSR-type results for time-varying directed graphs.\n\n- Byzantine-robust update (practical implementation)\n  - Each non-faulty agent i collects neighbor states x_k(t) from in-neighbors at time t (allowing delays; see note on asynchronous extensions below).\n  - Apply a robust aggregation on each coordinate or on the whole vector:\n    - MSR-like rule: discard the f largest and f smallest values for each coordinate (or for the entire vector using a suitable distance-based ordering), then average the remaining values.\n    - Alternatives (if you prefer): trimmed-mean per coordinate, median-of-means, or a robust consensus variant such as Krum/Bulyan (with per-step computational caveats).\n  - Update form (synchronous baseline): x_i(t+1) = w_ii x_i(t) + sum_{k ∈ N_i^−(t)} w_{ik} x_k(t), where the weights are derived from the robust-aggregation of the in-neighbors after trimming. With asynchronous delays, use time stamps and bound delays to keep updates consistent.\n  - Reference to s: all honest agents aim toward the fixed, known s. The robust-aggregated input is still driven toward s as long as non-faulty inputs concentrate around s.\n\n- Non-compensatory M_NC with robustness\n  - Define M_NC^robust(t) using the state that results from the robust aggregation step (i.e., using the post-robust-update states, or the robust-aggregated neighbor input that feeds each x_i(t+1)).\n  - The non-compensatory nature is preserved: a large deviation in any coordinate by up to f Byzantine peers will be attenuated by the trimming/robust step, but a persistent large deviation by ≥ f adversaries can still prevent exact agreement. The metric M_NC^robust(t) should be evaluated on the robust-consensus trajectory.\n  - ε-consensus under M_NC^robust: M_NC^robust(t) ≤ ε for a target ε that depends on the noise bounds (if any), the robustness properties of the aggregator, and the update gain.\n\n- Practical design notes\n  - Required load and topology: each node should have in-degree ≥ 2f + 1 in every relevant window, and the time-varying graph must be jointly connected over windows of length T_w. This ensures that after trimming f outliers on each coordinate, at least f+1 non-faulty values remain to influence each coordinate.\n  - Complexity: per-step complexity is O(deg_in(i) log deg_in(i)) if you sort to trim f largest/smallest; with optimizations you can do partial selection in O(deg_in(i)) time. Memory scales with the number of tracked neighbors and the dimension d.\n  - Asynchrony and delays: the MSR-type approach extends to asynchronous models with bounded delays under analogous connectivity assumptions, but you typically need a stronger in-degree condition and a bound on the maximum delay to guarantee similar convergence properties.\n  - Robustness vs performance trade-off: increasing f reduces the speed of convergence and can increase the steady-state error in the presence of noise. Choose f = ⌊(N − 1)/3⌋ as a safe maximum; if you know fewer adversaries will appear, you can conservatively set f lower to improve performance.\n\nWhat this means for your Q&A\n- Answer: Tolerate up to f = ⌊(N − 1)/3⌋ Byzantine agents. Yes, define M_NC in a Byzantine-robust way (MSR-type or other robust aggregators) and evaluate M_NC on the trajectory produced by the robust update. This combination provides concrete, provable guarantees under the standard assumptions (N ≥ 3f+1, sufficient in-degree, joint connectivity over time windows) and yields a meaningful ε-consensus notion for the non-compensatory metric in the presence of adversaries.",
      "Short answer: Define and compute M_NC in a fully distributed online manner. A central coordinator should not be required (and is not ideal) for deployment, though a centralizer can be used as a baseline or for offline evaluation.\n\nDetails and rationale\n\n- Why distributed online is preferred\n  - Alignment with the consensus setting: the whole point of the framework is to reason about what the network of agents can agree on using only local communication.\n  - Scalability and robustness: no single point of failure or bottleneck. Works with asynchronous updates, time-varying directed graphs, and bounded delays.\n  - Privacy and practicality: agents keep their own states locally; no need to send everything to a central node.\n  - Real-time operation: online computation via local data and neighbor communications yields immediate M_NC values without waiting for a central pass.\n\n- When a central coordinator might be acceptable\n  - Small-scale experiments or offline validation where latency is not critical.\n  - Environments where a trusted central entity already exists and routing overhead is negligible.\n  - Use as a baseline to validate distributed implementations, not as the production mechanism.\n\nHow to implement M_NC in a distributed online fashion (high level)\n\nAssume you keep the same windowed definitions you proposed, e.g., M_NC^W1, M_NC^W2, M_NC^W3, but compute them via distributed consensus protocols rather than a central collector.\n\nKey building blocks you can implement locally\n\n1) Windowed max-deviation (M_NC^W1)\n- Local per-agent local window values: each agent i maintains D_i^j(τ) = |x_i^j(τ) − s^j| for τ ∈ [t−T, t].\n- Each agent stores U_i^j(t) = max_{τ∈[t−T,t]} D_i^j(τ).\n- Distributed max over i: run a fault-tolerant max-consensus (or simple flooding/weighted averaging with max operation) across the in-neighborhood to converge to M^j(t) = max_i U_i^j(t).\n- Global metric: M_NC^W1(t) = max_j M^j(t). This can be obtained by a small number of rounds of per-coordinate max-consensus circulating among neighbors.\n- Online computability: O(1) per-step per coordinate after you update the local D_i^j(t) and the window max.\n\n2) Windowed per-coordinate non-compensation via tolerance and time-coverage (M_NC^W2)\n- For each time τ, each agent i computes h_i^j(τ) = 1{ |x_i^j(τ) − s^j| ≤ δ_j }.\n- Each agent can locally contribute to the group p_j(τ) = (1/N) ∑_i h_i^j(τ). To avoid central gathering, perform a distributed average consensus on h_i^j(τ) in time τ to get a local estimate of p_j(τ) across the network. In practice, you run a few rounds of average-consensus on the vector {h_i^j(τ)} to converge to p_j(τ) at each τ.\n- Maintain the windowed minimum of p_j(τ) over τ ∈ [t−T, t], i.e., p_j,min(t) = min_{τ∈[t−T,t]} p_j(τ).\n- Compute M_NC^W2(t) = max_j [1 − p_j,min(t)] using another distributed max across coordinates.\n- Online computability: each τ you perform a small consensus for that τ, update the running min per coordinate, and then take a max across coordinates.\n\n3) Windowed lexicographic non-compensation (M_NC^W3)\n- Maintain per-coordinate window maxima e_k^*(t) = max_{τ∈[t−T,t]} |x_i^{π(k)}(τ) − s^{π(k)}| for the most important coordinate π(k) across all agents i (or have each agent contribute its own window max and then fuse via max-consensus).\n- Identify k* = the smallest index with e_k^*(t) > δ_{π(k)}. Set M_NC^W3(t) = e_{k*}^*(t) (or 0 if none exceed).\n- Implementation: run per-coordinate max-consensus for each k to compute e_k^*(t) in distributed fashion, then a simple coordinate-wise comparison to pick the first violating coordinate.\n\nNotes on asynchronous updates and delays\n- The above schemes are compatible with asynchronous operation and bounded delays. Use time-stamping and conservative buffering to ensure that contributions from past timestamps are not retroactively double-counted.\n- A typical assumption: joint connectivity over time windows (the union of graphs over a window is strongly connected) and bounded delays. With these, standard distributed max/average consensus tools guarantee convergence to the correct windowed M_NC values or accurate approximations within a small error.\n\nRobustness (Byzantine/adversarial agents)\n- If you need Byzantine resilience, incorporate robust aggregation in the local consensus steps:\n  - For max-like forms (W1, W3), you can use MSR/Krum-type selectors coordinate-wise before the max/aggregation step.\n  - For average-like steps (W2), use trimmed-mean or median-of-means aggregations per τ, per coordinate, before updating p_j(τ).\n- The same f-outlier tolerances and in-degree requirements apply as in the central setting, e.g., tolerate up to f Byzantine agents with N ≥ 3f+1 in appropriate directed-time-varying-graph conditions.\n\nWhat to report and how to implement in practice\n- Online protocol outline:\n  - Each agent stores local x_i(t), the reference s, buffers for the window [t−T, t], and auxiliary statistics for the chosen M_NC form.\n  - At each iteration, exchange relevant local summaries with neighbors (e.g., U_i^j(t), h_i^j(t), or per-coordinate window maxima).\n  - Run a small number of gossip/max-consensus rounds to fuse into global M^j(t) values or p_j,min(t), etc.\n  - Compute M_NC(t) according to the current windowed form (W1, W2, or W3) from the fused values.\n  - Use M_NC(t) to guide monitoring, triggering faults or replanning if M_NC(t) exceeds a threshold ε.\n- Computational and communication costs\n  - Per-step work is O(d * deg_in(i)) for each agent i, with constant-factor overhead for the number of consensus rounds per time step.\n  - Memory scales with the chosen window length T and the per-coordinate statistics (O(dT) per agent, but you can implement with running maxima/minima to keep it near O(d)).\n- Central coordinator caveat\n  - A central aggregator can compute M_NC consistently and with minimal local computation, but it defeats the distributed robustness, introduces a single point of failure, and may incur additional latency. It can be used as an offline evaluator or a debugging baseline but is not recommended as the production mechanism.\n\nBottom line\n- M_NC should be defined and computed in a fully distributed online manner, using local data and neighbor communications, with windowed formulations to capture persistent non-compensation and to tolerate noise.\n- A central coordinator can be used only as a baseline/evaluation tool, not as the primary mechanism for real-time operation in a distributed network.",
      "Answer: Develop and prove M_NC^W1 (windowed max deviation) first.\n\nReason:\n- It embodies the strongest non-compensation: a single large deviation in any agent, coordinate, or time within the window drives the metric up, which gives a clear, interpretable ε-consensus target (M_NC^W1(t) ≤ ε).\n- It is the simplest to define and compute online: you keep a per-(i,j) running max over the window [t−T,t], then take a global max across i, j. This yields a natural, conservative robustness guarantee.\n- It generalizes directly to asynchronous/delay-tolerant settings with a sliding window and standard consensus mixing assumptions, and provides a clean baseline against which the other, more nuanced forms (W2, W3) can be compared.\n\nIf you want, I can start by delivering the precise mathematical definition, ε-consensus criterion, and a sketch of convergence/robustness results for M_NC^W1, then proceed to M_NC^W2 and M_NC^W3 in follow-ups. If you’d prefer a different starting form, tell me (W2 or W3) and I’ll adapt."

  "answers": [
    "Answer: Fix s and make it globally known to all agents.\n\nReasoning:\n- Having a fixed, known reference provides a well-defined target for the non-compensatory metrics M_NC and enables straightforward ε-consensus definitions (errors are measured relative to the same s for all agents and coordinates).\n- It simplifies analysis: convergence/robustness results, online computation of M_NC, and comparisons with standard consensus metrics become tractable when the target is common and known.\n- It avoids identifiability issues that arise if s must be inferred while also tracking x_i(t).\n\nOptional note (if you want unknown s in a future extension):\n- You can extend the framework to joint estimation of s and x_i(t) (distributed estimation of s) and redefine M_NC to use ŝ(t) (the agents’ estimates of s) in place of s. This couples consensus with a parameter-estimation problem and increases complexity, but is feasible with additional assumptions (e.g., persistent excitation, shared observation models, or a dedicated observer/consensus layer for s).",
    "Answer: Design the framework to handle asynchronous updates with bounded communication delays (i.e., allow asynchrony and delays as the default). The strictly synchronous case can be treated as a special case (zero delays and synchronized updates) for intuition and initial analysis.\n\nRationale (brief):\n- Real networks are inherently asynchronous due to computation times, scheduling, and communication delays. Designing for asynchrony makes M_NC applicable in practice.\n- Bounded-delay asynchronous models (e.g., joint connectivity over time windows, delayed reads, and eventual updates) are standard in modern consensus theory and enable meaningful convergence/robustness results.\n- Having asynchronous capability also simplifies handling directed graphs, time-varying topologies, and potential mis-timings across agents.\n\nIf you want, I can also outline a concrete asynchronous update model (with delays and time-stamped communications) and show how M_NC can be computed online under that model, with synchronous as a special-case reduction.",
    "Answer: Use a sliding time window [t−T, t] to define M_NC. That is, evaluate the non-compensatory metric on the history of states over a horizon T, not just on the instantaneous state at time t. This captures persistent deviations, filters out transient noise, and yields a meaningful notion of ε-consensus under non-compensatory criteria. The windowed definition can be made online with FIFO buffers or running maxima, and T can be tuned to the network’s mixing/consensus time. Note that T = 0 reduces to the instantaneous case as a special, less robust variant.\n\nThree concrete windowed forms (well-defined and computable online)\n\n1) Windowed max-deviation (strongest non-compensation)\n- Definition: For t ≥ 0,\n  M_NC^W1(t) = max over i in {1..N}, j in {1..d}, τ in [t−T, t] of |x_i^j(τ) − s^j|.\n  Equivalently, M_NC^W1(t) = max_i max_j max_{τ∈[t−T,t]} |x_i^j(τ) − s^j|.\n- ε-consensus: M_NC^W1(t) ≤ ε.\n- Commentary: A single large deviation in any coordinate for any agent within the window drives the metric up, ensuring non-compensation across coordinates and time.\n- Online computability: Maintain for each (i, j) the running maximum of |x_i^j(τ) − s^j| over the window; take the global max across i, j. With a sliding window, you can implement this with per-track buffers and a deque to drop the oldest sample.\n\n2) Windowed per-coordinate non-compensation via tolerance and time-coverage\n- Setup: Pick coordinate tolerances δ_j > 0 for j = 1..d.\n- For each τ, define p_j(τ) = (1/N) ∑_{i=1}^N 1{ |x_i^j(τ) − s^j| ≤ δ_j } (the fraction of agents within tolerance for coordinate j at time τ).\n- Definition: M_NC^W2(t) = max_{j=1..d} [ 1 − min_{τ∈[t−T,t]} p_j(τ) ].\n- ε-consensus: M_NC^W2(t) ≤ ε.\n- Commentary: A coordinate is “non-consensual” if, at some time in the window, too few agents stay within the per-coordinate tolerance δ_j. The max over coordinates enforces non-compensation across coordinates in time.\n- Online computability: For each τ in the window, compute p_j(τ) from the current x_i^j(τ); maintain the minimum p_j over the window for all j; M_NC^W2(t) is the maximum of 1 − min p_j across coordinates.\n\n3) Windowed lexicographic/non-compensatory with priority among coordinates\n- Assume a fixed importance order of coordinates π(1), π(2), ..., π(d).\n- For each k = 1..d, define e_k^* = max_{τ∈[t−T,t]} max_i |x_i^{π(k)}(τ) − s^{π(k)}|.\n- Define a lexicographic non-compensation score:\n  - Let k* be the smallest index k for which e_k^* > δ_{π(k)}; if none, set M_NC^W3(t) = 0.\n  - Otherwise, M_NC^W3(t) = e_{k*}^* (the first-most-important coordinate that violates its tolerance, with magnitude of its worst deviation).\n- ε-consensus: M_NC^W3(t) ≤ ε.\n- Commentary: Higher-priority coordinates dominate the metric; deviations in more important coordinates cannot be “compensated” by better performance in less important ones.\n- Online computability: Maintain e_k^* as the maximum deviation for each coordinate in the window; identify the first coordinate whose e_k^* exceeds its δ and report its value.\n\nNotes and practical guidance\n\n- Why a window is preferable: In non-compensatory design, a single large error in any coordinate should degrade consensus regardless of other coordinates. Playing out over a window reduces sensitivity to transient noise, faults, or brief misalignments and focuses on sustained disagreement that matters for real deployments.\n- Tuning and interpretation:\n  - T should be chosen on the time-scale of the network’s convergence (mixing) time and the expected dynamics of x_i(t). If T is too small, you resemble instantaneous metrics; if too large, you may over-smooth and delay detection of issues.\n  - δ_j (for Form 2 and 3) and the priority order π should reflect domain importance; you can fix them a priori or adapt them if you have domain knowledge.\n- Special case: T = 0 yields the instantaneous M_NC forms as a special case (no history). In practice, handing a nonzero T is recommended for robustness.\n- Relationship to standard consensus notions: If M_NC^W1 ≤ ε for a small ε, then all coordinates of all agents stayed within ε of s across the whole window; this implies a strong form of ε-consensus that is robust to short-lived deviations.\n- Computational considerations:\n  - Form 1: O(Nd) time per step, O(Nd) memory for the windowed maxima (plus buffers to drop old samples).\n  - Form 2: O(Nd) time per step to compute p_j(τ) across the window if you maintain per-τ statistics; can be optimized with incremental counts and sliding windows.\n  - Form 3: O(Nd) time per step to update e_k^* for each coordinate; requires maintaining per-coordinate maxima over the window.\n\nSummary answer\n- Use a sliding window [t−T, t] to define M_NC. It provides a robust, online, non-compensatory measure that accounts for history and is adaptable to asynchronous, time-varying dynamics.\n- The three concrete windowed forms above give explicit, implementable definitions with clear ε-consensus criteria.\n- If you want a purely instantaneous version later, you can treat T = 0 as a special case, but the windowed definitions are the recommended default for practical non-compensatory consensus evaluation.",
    "Answer: Use adaptive, time-varying window lengths per coordinate (T_j(t)), with a simple, bounded update rule. This best reflects changing consensus time scales across coordinates and agents, improves robustness to noise and transient disturbances, and keeps online computability.\n\nRationale (brief):\n- Different coordinates can converge at different rates; a fixed global T may be too small for some and too large for others.\n- An adaptive T_j(t) tracks the current mixing/consensus time scale, reducing false alarms from short-lived fluctuations and preserving responsiveness during fast convergence.\n- Per-coordinate adaptation is straightforward to implement and can be bounded to maintain online computability.\n\nProposed adaptive scheme (per-coordinate T_j(t)):\n- Notation: For each coordinate j ∈ {1, …, d}, maintain a window length T_j(t) ∈ [T_min, T_max], with T_min and T_max chosen a priori. Initialize T_j(0) = T_min.\n- Per time t, compute:\n  - D_j(t) = max_i |x_i^j(t) − s^j| (worst deviation across agents for coordinate j).\n  - ε_j is the per-coordinate tolerance (can be uniform or chosen per domain).\n  - Bad indicator: B_j(t) = 1 if D_j(t) > ε_j, else B_j(t) = 0.\n- Maintain a simple streak counter:\n  - streak_j(t) = (streak_j(t−1) + 1) if B_j(t) = 1, else 0.\n- Update rule (discrete steps, with small increments):\n  - If streak_j(t) ≥ S_up, then T_j(t+1) = min(T_max, T_j(t) + Δ).\n  - Else if streak_j(t) = 0 for K_down consecutive steps, then T_j(t+1) = max(T_min, T_j(t) − Δ).\n  - Otherwise, T_j(t+1) = T_j(t).\n- Parameters to pick:\n  - T_min and T_max: e.g., T_min = 5 samples, T_max = 200 samples (adjust to the network’s sampling rate and mixing time).\n  - Δ: a small step, e.g., Δ = 1 (in samples).\n  - S_up: e.g., 3–5 consecutive steps with D_j(t) > ε_j before increasing T.\n  - K_down: e.g., 5–10 consecutive steps with D_j(t) ≤ ε_j before decreasing T.\n- Optional simplifications:\n  - If desired, share a common baseline: compute T_common(t) using the aggregate of all coordinates (e.g., average of T_j(t)) and apply it to all coordinates, plus a small per-coordinate jitter. This reduces bookkeeping while still adapting to overall dynamics.\n  - Alternatively, fix a single global T_min ≤ T ≤ T_max as a fallback if implementation simplicity is paramount.\n\nOnline computability and storage:\n- Each coordinate requires only:\n  - O(1) memory for D_j(t), ε_j, B_j(t), streak_j(t), and T_j(t).\n  - O(1) computation per time step per coordinate to update D_j(t) and T_j(t).\n- Overall complexity remains O(Nd) per time step for computing D_j(t) plus O(d) for the window adaptation.\n\nFallback option:\n- If you prefer to keep things simple, you can start with a fixed global T (the same T across all coordinates) and switch to the adaptive scheme if empirical results show persistent misalignment or sensitivity to noise.\n\nBottom line:\n- Adopt adaptive, per-coordinate window lengths T_j(t) with bounded limits and a simple, event-driven update rule. This provides a practical balance between responsiveness and robustness, while preserving the non-compensatory nature of M_NC. If you later need a simpler baseline, you can operate with a fixed T as a special case.",
    "Short answer\n\n- Maximum tolerated Byzantine/malicious agents: f = ⌊(N − 1) / 3⌋. In other words, you can tolerate up to f Byzantine agents provided N ≥ 3f + 1 (and the usual connectivity conditions described below).\n- Should M_NC incorporate Byzantine-robust mechanisms? Yes. Use Byzantine-robust aggregation (MSR-type, trimmed-mean, median-of-means, Krum/Bulyan variants, etc.) inside the update rule so that non-faulty agents drive the group toward the reference despite up to f adversaries.\n\nConcrete guidance and minimal assumptions\n\n- Fault tolerance bound\n  - Let f be the maximum number of Byzantine agents to tolerate. Require N ≥ 3f + 1.\n  - In directed/time-varying graphs, strengthen with a windowed connectivity assumption: over every time window of length T_w, the union of the graphs is strongly connected and each non-faulty node has at least 2f + 1 in-neighbors within that window (i.e., an f-resilient condition). This mirrors standard MSR-type results for time-varying directed graphs.\n\n- Byzantine-robust update (practical implementation)\n  - Each non-faulty agent i collects neighbor states x_k(t) from in-neighbors at time t (allowing delays; see note on asynchronous extensions below).\n  - Apply a robust aggregation on each coordinate or on the whole vector:\n    - MSR-like rule: discard the f largest and f smallest values for each coordinate (or for the entire vector using a suitable distance-based ordering), then average the remaining values.\n    - Alternatives (if you prefer): trimmed-mean per coordinate, median-of-means, or a robust consensus variant such as Krum/Bulyan (with per-step computational caveats).\n  - Update form (synchronous baseline): x_i(t+1) = w_ii x_i(t) + sum_{k ∈ N_i^−(t)} w_{ik} x_k(t), where the weights are derived from the robust-aggregation of the in-neighbors after trimming. With asynchronous delays, use time stamps and bound delays to keep updates consistent.\n  - Reference to s: all honest agents aim toward the fixed, known s. The robust-aggregated input is still driven toward s as long as non-faulty inputs concentrate around s.\n\n- Non-compensatory M_NC with robustness\n  - Define M_NC^robust(t) using the state that results from the robust aggregation step (i.e., using the post-robust-update states, or the robust-aggregated neighbor input that feeds each x_i(t+1)).\n  - The non-compensatory nature is preserved: a large deviation in any coordinate by up to f Byzantine peers will be attenuated by the trimming/robust step, but a persistent large deviation by ≥ f adversaries can still prevent exact agreement. The metric M_NC^robust(t) should be evaluated on the robust-consensus trajectory.\n  - ε-consensus under M_NC^robust: M_NC^robust(t) ≤ ε for a target ε that depends on the noise bounds (if any), the robustness properties of the aggregator, and the update gain.\n\n- Practical design notes\n  - Required load and topology: each node should have in-degree ≥ 2f + 1 in every relevant window, and the time-varying graph must be jointly connected over windows of length T_w. This ensures that after trimming f outliers on each coordinate, at least f+1 non-faulty values remain to influence each coordinate.\n  - Complexity: per-step complexity is O(deg_in(i) log deg_in(i)) if you sort to trim f largest/smallest; with optimizations you can do partial selection in O(deg_in(i)) time. Memory scales with the number of tracked neighbors and the dimension d.\n  - Asynchrony and delays: the MSR-type approach extends to asynchronous models with bounded delays under analogous connectivity assumptions, but you typically need a stronger in-degree condition and a bound on the maximum delay to guarantee similar convergence properties.\n  - Robustness vs performance trade-off: increasing f reduces the speed of convergence and can increase the steady-state error in the presence of noise. Choose f = ⌊(N − 1)/3⌋ as a safe maximum; if you know fewer adversaries will appear, you can conservatively set f lower to improve performance.\n\nWhat this means for your Q&A\n- Answer: Tolerate up to f = ⌊(N − 1)/3⌋ Byzantine agents. Yes, define M_NC in a Byzantine-robust way (MSR-type or other robust aggregators) and evaluate M_NC on the trajectory produced by the robust update. This combination provides concrete, provable guarantees under the standard assumptions (N ≥ 3f+1, sufficient in-degree, joint connectivity over time windows) and yields a meaningful ε-consensus notion for the non-compensatory metric in the presence of adversaries.",
    "Short answer: Define and compute M_NC in a fully distributed online manner. A central coordinator should not be required (and is not ideal) for deployment, though a centralizer can be used as a baseline or for offline evaluation.\n\nDetails and rationale\n\n- Why distributed online is preferred\n  - Alignment with the consensus setting: the whole point of the framework is to reason about what the network of agents can agree on using only local communication.\n  - Scalability and robustness: no single point of failure or bottleneck. Works with asynchronous updates, time-varying directed graphs, and bounded delays.\n  - Privacy and practicality: agents keep their own states locally; no need to send everything to a central node.\n  - Real-time operation: online computation via local data and neighbor communications yields immediate M_NC values without waiting for a central pass.\n\n- When a central coordinator might be acceptable\n  - Small-scale experiments or offline validation where latency is not critical.\n  - Environments where a trusted central entity already exists and routing overhead is negligible.\n  - Use as a baseline to validate distributed implementations, not as the production mechanism.\n\nHow to implement M_NC in a distributed online fashion (high level)\n\nAssume you keep the same windowed definitions you proposed, e.g., M_NC^W1, M_NC^W2, M_NC^W3, but compute them via distributed consensus protocols rather than a central collector.\n\nKey building blocks you can implement locally\n\n1) Windowed max-deviation (M_NC^W1)\n- Local per-agent local window values: each agent i maintains D_i^j(τ) = |x_i^j(τ) − s^j| for τ ∈ [t−T, t].\n- Each agent stores U_i^j(t) = max_{τ∈[t−T,t]} D_i^j(τ).\n- Distributed max over i: run a fault-tolerant max-consensus (or simple flooding/weighted averaging with max operation) across the in-neighborhood to converge to M^j(t) = max_i U_i^j(t).\n- Global metric: M_NC^W1(t) = max_j M^j(t). This can be obtained by a small number of rounds of per-coordinate max-consensus circulating among neighbors.\n- Online computability: O(1) per-step per coordinate after you update the local D_i^j(t) and the window max.\n\n2) Windowed per-coordinate non-compensation via tolerance and time-coverage (M_NC^W2)\n- For each time τ, each agent i computes h_i^j(τ) = 1{ |x_i^j(τ) − s^j| ≤ δ_j }.\n- Each agent can locally contribute to the group p_j(τ) = (1/N) ∑_i h_i^j(τ). To avoid central gathering, perform a distributed average consensus on h_i^j(τ) in time τ to get a local estimate of p_j(τ) across the network. In practice, you run a few rounds of average-consensus on the vector {h_i^j(τ)} to converge to p_j(τ) at each τ.\n- Maintain the windowed minimum of p_j(τ) over τ ∈ [t−T, t], i.e., p_j,min(t) = min_{τ∈[t−T,t]} p_j(τ).\n- Compute M_NC^W2(t) = max_j [1 − p_j,min(t)] using another distributed max across coordinates.\n- Online computability: each τ you perform a small consensus for that τ, update the running min per coordinate, and then take a max across coordinates.\n\n3) Windowed lexicographic non-compensation (M_NC^W3)\n- Maintain per-coordinate window maxima e_k^*(t) = max_{τ∈[t−T,t]} |x_i^{π(k)}(τ) − s^{π(k)}| for the most important coordinate π(k) across all agents i (or have each agent contribute its own window max and then fuse via max-consensus).\n- Identify k* = the smallest index with e_k^*(t) > δ_{π(k)}. Set M_NC^W3(t) = e_{k*}^*(t) (or 0 if none exceed).\n- Implementation: run per-coordinate max-consensus for each k to compute e_k^*(t) in distributed fashion, then a simple coordinate-wise comparison to pick the first violating coordinate.\n\nNotes on asynchronous updates and delays\n- The above schemes are compatible with asynchronous operation and bounded delays. Use time-stamping and conservative buffering to ensure that contributions from past timestamps are not retroactively double-counted.\n- A typical assumption: joint connectivity over time windows (the union of graphs over a window is strongly connected) and bounded delays. With these, standard distributed max/average consensus tools guarantee convergence to the correct windowed M_NC values or accurate approximations within a small error.\n\nRobustness (Byzantine/adversarial agents)\n- If you need Byzantine resilience, incorporate robust aggregation in the local consensus steps:\n  - For max-like forms (W1, W3), you can use MSR/Krum-type selectors coordinate-wise before the max/aggregation step.\n  - For average-like steps (W2), use trimmed-mean or median-of-means aggregations per τ, per coordinate, before updating p_j(τ).\n- The same f-outlier tolerances and in-degree requirements apply as in the central setting, e.g., tolerate up to f Byzantine agents with N ≥ 3f+1 in appropriate directed-time-varying-graph conditions.\n\nWhat to report and how to implement in practice\n- Online protocol outline:\n  - Each agent stores local x_i(t), the reference s, buffers for the window [t−T, t], and auxiliary statistics for the chosen M_NC form.\n  - At each iteration, exchange relevant local summaries with neighbors (e.g., U_i^j(t), h_i^j(t), or per-coordinate window maxima).\n  - Run a small number of gossip/max-consensus rounds to fuse into global M^j(t) values or p_j,min(t), etc.\n  - Compute M_NC(t) according to the current windowed form (W1, W2, or W3) from the fused values.\n  - Use M_NC(t) to guide monitoring, triggering faults or replanning if M_NC(t) exceeds a threshold ε.\n- Computational and communication costs\n  - Per-step work is O(d * deg_in(i)) for each agent i, with constant-factor overhead for the number of consensus rounds per time step.\n  - Memory scales with the chosen window length T and the per-coordinate statistics (O(dT) per agent, but you can implement with running maxima/minima to keep it near O(d)).\n- Central coordinator caveat\n  - A central aggregator can compute M_NC consistently and with minimal local computation, but it defeats the distributed robustness, introduces a single point of failure, and may incur additional latency. It can be used as an offline evaluator or a debugging baseline but is not recommended as the production mechanism.\n\nBottom line\n- M_NC should be defined and computed in a fully distributed online manner, using local data and neighbor communications, with windowed formulations to capture persistent non-compensation and to tolerate noise.\n- A central coordinator can be used only as a baseline/evaluation tool, not as the primary mechanism for real-time operation in a distributed network.",
    "Answer: Develop and prove M_NC^W1 (windowed max deviation) first.\n\nReason:\n- It embodies the strongest non-compensation: a single large deviation in any agent, coordinate, or time within the window drives the metric up, which gives a clear, interpretable ε-consensus target (M_NC^W1(t) ≤ ε).\n- It is the simplest to define and compute online: you keep a per-(i,j) running max over the window [t−T,t], then take a global max across i, j. This yields a natural, conservative robustness guarantee.\n- It generalizes directly to asynchronous/delay-tolerant settings with a sliding window and standard consensus mixing assumptions, and provides a clean baseline against which the other, more nuanced forms (W2, W3) can be compared.\n\nIf you want, I can start by delivering the precise mathematical definition, ε-consensus criterion, and a sketch of convergence/robustness results for M_NC^W1, then proceed to M_NC^W2 and M_NC^W3 in follow-ups. If you’d prefer a different starting form, tell me (W2 or W3) and I’ll adapt."
