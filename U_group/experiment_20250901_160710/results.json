    "[Query] What are the key principles of effective machine learning model evaluation?",
    "[A4 Question]: Which type of ML task and evaluation context do you mean — e.g., binary/multi-class classification, regression, ranking, time-series forecasting, or unsupervised learning — and is the goal development-stage comparison, pre-deployment validation, or ongoing production monitoring?",
    "[A3 Answer]: Here’s a clear, specific mapping you can use. Pick your task type and the evaluation context, and follow the listed targets.\n\n1) Classification (binary or multi-class)\n- Development-stage (model comparison)\n  - Metrics: AUROC, AUPRC, accuracy, precision, recall, F1; calibration (calibration plots, Brier score).\n  - Evaluation methods: stratified k-fold cross-validation; paired statistical tests (e.g., DeLong for AUROC; McNemar for accuracy/discordant pairs).\n  - Additional checks: confusion matrix; baseline/transparent models; feature importance sanity checks.\n- Pre-deployment validation\n  - Hold-out test set (often temporally split to mimic future data); assess calibration and fairness.\n  - Robustness: test against simple distribution shifts; noise perturbations; adversarial examples if relevant.\n  - Deployment constraints: latency, memory, throughput; scalable inference.\n- Production monitoring\n  - Online metrics: AUROC, F1, calibration stability over time.\n  - Drift detection: covariate shift (P(X)), concept drift (P(Y|X)).\n  - Safety and fairness: ongoing demographic parity/equalized odds checks; alert thresholds; retraining triggers.\n  - Observability: model versioning, reproducibility, A/B/n testing plans.\n\n2) Regression\n- Development-stage\n  - Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R^2, explained variance; residual analysis (heteroskedasticity, nonlinearity).\n  - Validation: cross-validation with time-aware splits if temporal; error distribution checks.\n  - Prediction intervals: calibrated interval estimates if uncertainty matters.\n- Pre-deployment validation\n  - Temporal/hold-out test to resemble future data; assess interval coverage and calibration.\n  - Robustness: sensitivity to outliers; feature perturbations.\n- Production monitoring\n  - Ongoing error metrics (RMSE/MAE) and distribution of residuals.\n  - Drift/recall: changes in target distribution; retraining triggers; monitoring latency.\n  - Uncertainty: recalibration of prediction intervals as data shifts occur.\n\n3) Ranking\n- Development-stage\n  - Metrics: NDCG@k, MAP@k, precision@k, recall@k; sometimes ROC-like metrics sparingly.\n  - Evaluation: proper test splits ensuring fair item exposure; statistical comparison of rank lists.\n- Pre-deployment validation\n  - Hold-out ranking evaluation; check for bias in item exposure or position bias.\n  - Calibration of scores if used for thresholding in downstream systems.\n- Production monitoring\n  - Online ranking stability: drift in item ordering, click-through signal shifts.\n  - A/B testing for user-centric impact and business metrics; latency considerations.\n\n4) Time-series forecasting\n- Development-stage\n  - Metrics: RMSE, MAE, MAPE, sMAPE; CRPS for probabilistic forecasts; backtesting results.\n  - Validation: walk-forward cross-validation; temporal leakage prevention.\n- Pre-deployment validation\n  - Walk-forward/rolling-origin validation on recent windows; check interval forecasts if provided.\n  - Calibration of predictive intervals if probabilistic forecasts are used.\n- Production monitoring\n  - Continuous performance tracking; drift in seasonality, trends, or regime changes.\n  - Retraining triggers based on error thresholds or detected drift; latency and update cadence.\n\n5) Unsupervised learning (clustering, anomaly detection)\n- Development-stage\n  - Clustering: internal indices ( silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin); external indices if labels exist (ARI, NMI).\n  - Anomaly detection: precision/recall against labeled anomalies if available; ROC/AUC on anomaly scores; calibration of scores.\n- Pre-deployment validation\n  - Stability checks across subsamples; domain expert review of clusters/anomalies; reproducibility across runs.\n- Production monitoring\n  - Stability of clusters or anomaly scores over time; drift in data distribution; retraining or recalibration triggers.\n\nCross-cutting considerations applicable to all task types\n- Data integrity and leakage prevention: ensure no information from the test set leaks into training; maintain proper train/validation/test separation.\n- Baselines and statistical significance: compare against strong baselines; report confidence intervals and conduct significance tests where appropriate.\n- Reproducibility and experiment tracking: version data, features, and code; lock random seeds where feasible; document evaluation pipelines.\n- Deployment constraints: latency, memory, throughput, hardware constraints; model size vs. accuracy trade-offs.\n- Fairness and safety: where relevant, assess disparate impact (demographic parity, equalized odds, equal opportunity) and monitor over time.\n- Interpretability and explainability: offer explanations (SHAP/LIME, feature importances) if required by stakeholders or regulators.\n- Data and concept drift readiness: establish monitoring dashboards, alerting, and retraining/rollback plans.\n\nIf you share your exact task type and which stage you’re evaluating for (development-stage comparison, pre-deployment validation, or ongoing production monitoring), I can provide a tightly tailored, step-by-step evaluation plan with concrete metrics, data splits, and a sample reporting checklist.",
    "[A1 Question]: Could you specify which machine learning task (e.g., classification, regression, ranking, time-series forecasting, or unsupervised learning) and which evaluation stage (development, pre-deployment, or production monitoring) you're most interested in?",
    "[A3 Answer]: Please specify two items so I can tailor the evaluation guidance:\n\n- Task type:Classification (binary or multi-class), Regression, Ranking, Time-series forecasting, or Unsupervised learning (clustering/anomaly detection). If you’re not sure, describe your problem briefly and I’ll map it to one of these.\n\n- Evaluation stage: Development-stage (model comparison and feature engineering), Pre-deployment validation (hold-out testing, calibration, fairness, robustness), or Production monitoring (drift detection, online metrics, retraining triggers).\n\nOnce you pick these, I’ll provide a focused, step-by-step evaluation plan with the appropriate metrics, data splits, reporting checklist, and any deployment constraints.",
    "[A3 Question]: Could you specify the exact ML task (classification, regression, ranking, time-series forecasting, or unsupervised) and the evaluation stage (development-stage comparison, pre-deployment validation, or production monitoring) you’re focusing on?",
    "[A4 Answer]: Please pick two items so I can give a targeted evaluation plan:\n\n1) Task type (choose one)\n- Classification — binary or multi-class; label per example.\n- Regression — continuous target.\n- Ranking — produce ordered lists / relevance scores.\n- Time-series forecasting — target(s) evolve over time; temporal dependence matters.\n- Unsupervised — clustering or anomaly detection; no (or few) labels.\n\n2) Evaluation stage (choose one)\n- Development-stage (model/feature comparison, cross-validation, metric selection).\n- Pre-deployment validation (final hold-out tests, calibration, robustness, fairness checks).\n- Production monitoring (online metrics, drift detection, retraining/rollback rules).\n\nIf you’re unsure, reply with a 1–2 sentence description of your problem and constraints (label type, whether data are time-ordered, any latency/memory limits, important fairness groups). Example reply formats you can copy:\n\n- “Task: Classification (multi-class). Stage: Pre-deployment validation.”\n- “Task: Time-series forecasting. Stage: Production monitoring.”\n- Or: “Problem: Predict customer churn monthly (binary), data are time-stamped; I need pre-deployment validation and monitoring guidance.”\n\nAlso tell me any critical constraints to include (latency, model size, regulatory/fairness requirements, how many labeled examples). Once you answer, I’ll provide a step-by-step evaluation checklist, concrete metrics, data-splitting strategy, statistical tests, and monitoring/alerting rules tailored to your choice.",
    "[A3 Question]: Could you specify the ML task type (classification, regression, ranking, time-series forecasting, or unsupervised) and the evaluation stage (development, pre-deployment validation, or production monitoring) you want guidance for?",
    "[A4 Answer]: Please specify both a task type and an evaluation stage so I can give a focused plan. Below are the options and the key implications to help you choose.\n\nTask type (pick one)\n- Classification (binary or multi-class): discrete labels; evaluate with AUROC/AUPRC, accuracy, precision/recall/F1, calibration; watch class imbalance and subgroup fairness.\n- Regression: continuous target; use MAE/RMSE/R², residual analysis, prediction intervals; check heteroskedasticity and outlier sensitivity.\n- Ranking / Retrieval: ordered outputs; use NDCG@k, MAP@k, precision@k; consider exposure/position bias and online A/B tests.\n- Time-series forecasting: temporally dependent targets; require walk‑forward validation/backtesting, metrics like MAE/RMSE/MAPE, and probabilistic scores (CRPS) if applicable.\n- Unsupervised (clustering / anomaly detection): no/limited labels; use internal indices (silhouette), ARI/NMI if labels exist, or precision/recall on anomaly scores; assess stability and domain‑expert validation.\n\nEvaluation stage (pick one)\n- Development-stage (model/feature comparison): cross‑validation, hyperparameter search, paired statistical tests, baselines, error analysis.\n- Pre-deployment validation: final hold‑out (ideally time‑split if temporal), calibration, robustness tests (distributional shifts, adversarial/noise), fairness checks, latency/memory profiling.\n- Production monitoring: online metrics, drift detection (covariate vs concept), alerting and retraining rules, model/versioning, A/B testing and rollback strategies.\n\nAdditional details I need (optional but helpful)\n- Is data time‑ordered? (yes/no)\n- Approximate dataset size and labeled examples\n- Class imbalance severity or key subgroups for fairness checks\n- Latency, memory or model‑size constraints\n- Regulatory or interpretability requirements\n- Desired monitoring cadence (real‑time, hourly, daily)\n\nExample replies you can copy:\n- “Task: Classification (binary). Stage: Pre-deployment validation. Data are time‑stamped. Need latency <100 ms and must monitor demographic fairness.”\n- “Task: Time‑series forecasting. Stage: Production monitoring. Daily forecasts for 1000 series, retrain monthly.”\n\nPick a task and a stage (and any additional constraints) and I’ll return a step‑by‑step evaluation checklist with concrete metrics, data splits, statistical tests and monitoring rules.",
    "[A4 Question]: Which ML task (classification — binary or multi-class, regression, ranking, time-series forecasting, or unsupervised — clustering/anomaly detection) and which evaluation stage (development-stage model comparison, pre-deployment validation, or production monitoring) should I target?",
    "[A3 Answer]: Task type: Classification (binary or multi-class)\nEvaluation stage: Development-stage (model/feature comparison)\n\nRationale:\n- Classification is the most common starting point and maps to well-established evaluation workflows (stratified cross-validation, a broad set of metrics, and straightforward baselines).\n- Development-stage focus enables systematic comparison of models and features, supports statistical significance testing, and helps identify robust, well-calibrated approaches before deployment.\n\nIf your problem is clearly time-ordered, involves ranking, forecasting, or unsupervised learning, or you already know deployment considerations, I can tailor the plan for that specific task and stage.",
    "[A3 Question]: What is the level of class imbalance in your classification problem (i.e., what fraction or percentage does the minority class represent)?",
    "[A1 Answer]: To answer your question:\n\nThe level of class imbalance quantifies how unequally the classes are represented in your dataset for a classification task. It is typically measured as the proportion (or percentage) of the minority class among all labeled examples.\n\nExample calculation:  \nIf you have 1,000 total samples —\n- 950 are class A (majority)\n- 50 are class B (minority)\n\nThen, the minority class proportion = 50 / 1,000 = 0.05, or 5%.\n\nPlease provide either:\n- The exact counts of each class, or\n- The percentage or fraction of the minority class (e.g., “minority class is 3% of total examples”).\n\nThis information is critical for:\n- Selecting the right evaluation metrics (e.g., AUROC/AUPRC instead of accuracy in severe imbalance),\n- Choosing resampling or reweighting techniques,\n- Interpreting model reliability on rare outcomes.\n\nIf you are unsure, you can reply with your class counts or an estimate, and I will help you calculate and interpret the imbalance.",
    "[A3 Question]: What is the primary evaluation metric you want to optimize during development-stage classification (e.g., AUROC, AUPRC, accuracy, precision/recall/F1), and do you have target thresholds or acceptable ranges for that metric (considering any class imbalance)?",
    "[A4 Answer]: Short answer (pick one depending on your problem):\n\n- If binary classification with a rare positive class and you care about ranking/precision on positives: Primary metric = AUPRC (average precision).\n- If binary classification with roughly balanced classes or you care about overall ranking regardless of prevalence: Primary metric = AUROC.\n- If you must produce a hard label and care about a balanced trade-off between false positives and false negatives: Primary metric = F1 (choose macro-F1 for multiclass with imbalance, micro-F1 if you want instance-level weighting).\n- If false negatives (or false positives) dominate business cost: Primary metric = recall (or precision) at a chosen operating point.\n\nGuidance on acceptable targets and how to set them\n- Always compare to a baseline: random classifier baseline for AUPRC = prevalence p; for AUROC = 0.5. A useful rule: AUPRC should be meaningfully above p (aim for ≥2–5× p) rather than just above it.\n- Rule‑of‑thumb absolute targets (domain dependent):\n  - AUROC: 0.7 = fair, ≥0.8 = good, ≥0.9 = excellent.\n  - AUPRC: depends on prevalence — for p≈1%, AUPRC≥0.05–0.10 may already be useful; aim for ≥2–5× p and preferably ≥0.2 if possible.\n  - F1: ≥0.6 = usable, ≥0.75 = strong for many applications; require higher if decisions are critical.\n  - Precision/Recall: set concrete thresholds from business risk. Example: require recall ≥0.9 if missing positives is very costly; require precision ≥0.9 if false positives are expensive.\n- Use cost/utility to convert business needs to a numeric threshold: define costs C_FN, C_FP and choose the operating point that minimizes expected cost (or maximizes expected utility).\n\nPractical constraints and evaluation specs\n- For development-stage comparison, estimate metrics with stratified k‑fold CV (or time‑aware folds if temporal). Report mean ± 95% CI (bootstrap or CV paired tests).\n- When using AUPRC/AUROC, also report precision/recall (or sensitivity/specificity) at the chosen decision threshold, plus confusion matrix for interpretability.\n- For multiclass imbalanced problems, report per-class metrics and macro-averages; set per-class minimums for critical classes.\n- Always validate calibration if probabilities are used (Brier score, calibration plots); if poorly calibrated, re-calibrate (Platt scaling/isotonic).\n- If dataset is small or imbalance extreme, prefer AUPRC and report uncertainty; consider resampling, class weighting, or synthetic examples but evaluate on untouched hold-out.\n\nNext step\nIf you tell me: (a) binary vs multiclass, (b) prevalence of minority class, and (c) whether false negatives or false positives are costlier, I’ll give a single recommended primary metric, a concrete numeric target, and an evaluation checklist (data split, CV settings, CI method, and threshold selection rule).",
    "[A2 Question]: Could you specify which machine learning task (classification, regression, ranking, time-series forecasting, or unsupervised learning) and which evaluation stage (development-stage comparison, pre-deployment validation, or production monitoring) you want the key principles focused on?",
    "[A4 Answer]: Please pick one ML task and one evaluation stage so I can tailor the key principles precisely.\n\nTask (choose one)\n- Classification (binary or multi-class)\n- Regression (continuous target)\n- Ranking / retrieval\n- Time-series forecasting\n- Unsupervised (clustering or anomaly detection)\n\nEvaluation stage (choose one)\n- Development-stage (model/feature comparison, cross-validation)\n- Pre-deployment validation (final hold-out testing; calibration, robustness, fairness checks)\n- Production monitoring (online metrics, drift detection, retraining/rollback rules)\n\nOptional details that help me produce a concrete plan (include any that apply)\n- Is the data time-ordered? (yes/no)\n- Dataset size (approx. examples)\n- Class imbalance (minority % or class counts)\n- Key subgroups for fairness checks\n- Latency / memory / model-size constraints\n- Regulatory or interpretability requirements\n- Desired monitoring cadence (real-time, hourly, daily)\n\nExample replies you can copy\n- “Task: Classification (binary). Stage: Pre-deployment validation. Data time‑stamped. Latency <100 ms; must monitor demographic fairness.”\n- “Task: Time‑series forecasting. Stage: Production monitoring. Daily forecasts for 1,000 series; retrain monthly.”\n- “Task: Unsupervised anomaly detection. Stage: Development-stage. ~10k examples, rare anomalies (~0.5%).”\n\nReply with your choice and any optional details and I’ll give a step‑by‑step, task‑and-stage–specific evaluation checklist (metrics, data splits, statistical tests, robustness/fairness checks, and monitoring rules).",
    "[A4 Question]: Which ML task do you mean (classification, regression, ranking, time‑series forecasting, or unsupervised learning) and which evaluation stage should I focus on (development-stage model comparison, pre-deployment validation, or production monitoring)?",
    "[A1 Answer]: Task: Classification (binary or multi-class)  \nEvaluation stage: Development-stage model comparison\n\nFocus evaluation guidance and relevant principles on classification (including both binary and multi-class cases) at the development-stage, with an emphasis on model selection and comparative performance using appropriate metrics, validation, and error analysis.",
    "[A4 Question]: Which specific ML task (classification, regression, ranking, time‑series forecasting, or unsupervised learning) and which evaluation stage (development-stage model comparison, pre-deployment validation, or production monitoring) should I focus on?",
    "[A3 Answer]: - Task: Classification (binary or multi-class)\n- Evaluation stage: Development-stage model comparison\n\nIf you want, I can provide a focused, step-by-step evaluation plan tailored to this combination, including metrics, cross-validation strategy, baselines, calibration checks, and error analysis.",
    "[A3 Question]: Could you specify the approximate class distribution (e.g., the percentage or counts of the minority class) for your classification task? This will guide which metrics to emphasize and whether to use class weighting or resampling.",
    "[A2 Answer]: To specify the approximate class distribution for your classification task, please provide either:\n\n- The counts of each class (e.g., Class A: 950 examples, Class B: 50 examples), or  \n- The percentage or fraction that the minority class represents of the total dataset (e.g., minority class is 5%).\n\nKnowing this distribution is important because:  \n- Severe imbalance (e.g., minority class <5%) typically requires focusing on metrics sensitive to class imbalance such as AUPRC or recall and possibly applying techniques like class weighting or resampling.  \n- Balanced or moderately imbalanced datasets (e.g., minority class ≥20%) may allow use of general metrics like accuracy or AUROC without heavy adjustments.\n\nIf you do not have exact counts, an approximate percentage is still helpful. Once you share this info, I can recommend the most appropriate evaluation metrics, thresholds, and validation strategies tailored to your class distribution.",
    "[A3 Question]: Which exact ML task (classification, regression, ranking, time-series forecasting, or unsupervised) and evaluation stage (development-stage model comparison, pre-deployment validation, or production monitoring) are you focusing on?",
    "[A1 Answer]: Task: Classification (binary or multi-class)  \nEvaluation stage: Development-stage model comparison\n\nThis means you are interested in principles and best practices for evaluating and comparing different classification models (either binary or multi-class) during the initial development phase, prior to final validation or deployment. Evaluation should focus on robust comparison using cross-validation, appropriate selection of metrics (considering class imbalance and business context), careful error analysis, and basic calibration checks."

Pick your task type and the evaluation context, and follow the listed targets.\n\n1) Classification (binary or multi-class)\n- Development-stage (model comparison)\n  - Metrics: AUROC, AUPRC, accuracy, precision, recall, F1; calibration (calibration plots, Brier score).\n  - Evaluation methods: stratified k-fold cross-validation; paired statistical tests (e.g., DeLong for AUROC; McNemar for accuracy/discordant pairs).\n  - Additional checks: confusion matrix; baseline/transparent models; feature importance sanity checks.\n- Pre-deployment validation\n  - Hold-out test set (often temporally split to mimic future data); assess calibration and fairness.\n  - Robustness: test against simple distribution shifts; noise perturbations; adversarial examples if relevant.\n  - Deployment constraints: latency, memory, throughput; scalable inference.\n- Production monitoring\n  - Online metrics: AUROC, F1, calibration stability over time.\n  - Drift detection: covariate shift (P(X)), concept drift (P(Y|X)).\n  - Safety and fairness: ongoing demographic parity/equalized odds checks; alert thresholds; retraining triggers.\n  - Observability: model versioning, reproducibility, A/B/n testing plans.\n\n2) Regression\n- Development-stage\n  - Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R^2, explained variance; residual analysis (heteroskedasticity, nonlinearity).\n  - Validation: cross-validation with time-aware splits if temporal; error distribution checks.\n  - Prediction intervals: calibrated interval estimates if uncertainty matters.\n- Pre-deployment validation\n  - Temporal/hold-out test to resemble future data; assess interval coverage and calibration.\n  - Robustness: sensitivity to outliers; feature perturbations.\n- Production monitoring\n  - Ongoing error metrics (RMSE/MAE) and distribution of residuals.\n  - Drift/recall: changes in target distribution; retraining triggers; monitoring latency.\n  - Uncertainty: recalibration of prediction intervals as data shifts occur.\n\n3) Ranking\n- Development-stage\n  - Metrics: NDCG@k, MAP@k, precision@k, recall@k; sometimes ROC-like metrics sparingly.\n  - Evaluation: proper test splits ensuring fair item exposure; statistical comparison of rank lists.\n- Pre-deployment validation\n  - Hold-out ranking evaluation; check for bias in item exposure or position bias.\n  - Calibration of scores if used for thresholding in downstream systems.\n- Production monitoring\n  - Online ranking stability: drift in item ordering, click-through signal shifts.\n  - A/B testing for user-centric impact and business metrics; latency considerations.\n\n4) Time-series forecasting\n- Development-stage\n  - Metrics: RMSE, MAE, MAPE, sMAPE; CRPS for probabilistic forecasts; backtesting results.\n  - Validation: walk-forward cross-validation; temporal leakage prevention.\n- Pre-deployment validation\n  - Walk-forward/rolling-origin validation on recent windows; check interval forecasts if provided.\n  - Calibration of predictive intervals if probabilistic forecasts are used.\n- Production monitoring\n  - Continuous performance tracking; drift in seasonality, trends, or regime changes.\n  - Retraining triggers based on error thresholds or detected drift; latency and update cadence.\n\n5) Unsupervised learning (clustering, anomaly detection)\n- Development-stage\n  - Clustering: internal indices ( silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin); external indices if labels exist (ARI, NMI).\n  - Anomaly detection: precision/recall against labeled anomalies if available; ROC/AUC on anomaly scores; calibration of scores.\n- Pre-deployment validation\n  - Stability checks across subsamples; domain expert review of clusters/anomalies; reproducibility across runs.\n- Production monitoring\n  - Stability of clusters or anomaly scores over time; drift in data distribution; retraining or recalibration triggers.\n\nCross-cutting considerations applicable to all task types\n- Data integrity and leakage prevention: ensure no information from the test set leaks into training; maintain proper train/validation/test separation.\n- Baselines and statistical significance: compare against strong baselines; report confidence intervals and conduct significance tests where appropriate.\n- Reproducibility and experiment tracking: version data, features, and code; lock random seeds where feasible; document evaluation pipelines.\n- Deployment constraints: latency, memory, throughput, hardware constraints; model size vs. accuracy trade-offs.\n- Fairness and safety: where relevant, assess disparate impact (demographic parity, equalized odds, equal opportunity) and monitor over time.\n- Interpretability and explainability: offer explanations (SHAP/LIME, feature importances) if required by stakeholders or regulators.\n- Data and concept drift readiness: establish monitoring dashboards, alerting, and retraining/rollback plans.\n\nIf you share your exact task type and which stage you’re evaluating for (development-stage comparison, pre-deployment validation, or ongoing production monitoring), I can provide a tightly tailored, step-by-step evaluation plan with concrete metrics, data splits, and a sample reporting checklist.",

      "answer": "Please specify both a task type and an evaluation stage so I can give a focused plan. Below are the options and the key implications to help you choose.\n\nTask type (pick one)\n- Classification (binary or multi-class): discrete labels; evaluate with AUROC/AUPRC, accuracy, precision/recall/F1, calibration; watch class imbalance and subgroup fairness.\n- Regression: continuous target; use MAE/RMSE/R², residual analysis, prediction intervals; check heteroskedasticity and outlier sensitivity.\n- Ranking / Retrieval: ordered outputs; use NDCG@k, MAP@k, precision@k; consider exposure/position bias and online A/B tests.\n- Time-series forecasting: temporally dependent targets; require walk‑forward validation/backtesting, metrics like MAE/RMSE/MAPE, and probabilistic scores (CRPS) if applicable.\n- Unsupervised (clustering / anomaly detection): no/limited labels; use internal indices (silhouette), ARI/NMI if labels exist, or precision/recall on anomaly scores; assess stability and domain‑expert validation.\n\nEvaluation stage (pick one)\n- Development-stage (model/feature comparison): cross‑validation, hyperparameter search, paired statistical tests, baselines, error analysis.\n- Pre-deployment validation: final hold‑out (ideally time‑split if temporal), calibration, robustness tests (distributional shifts, adversarial/noise), fairness checks, latency/memory profiling.\n- Production monitoring: online metrics, drift detection (covariate vs concept), alerting and retraining rules, model/versioning, A/B testing and rollback strategies.\n\nAdditional details I need (optional but helpful)\n- Is data time‑ordered? (yes/no)\n- Approximate dataset size and labeled examples\n- Class imbalance severity or key subgroups for fairness checks\n- Latency, memory or model‑size constraints\n- Regulatory or interpretability requirements\n- Desired monitoring cadence (real‑time, hourly, daily)\n\nExample replies you can copy:\n- “Task: Classification (binary). Stage: Pre-deployment validation. Data are time‑stamped. Need latency <100 ms and must monitor demographic fairness.”\n- “Task: Time‑series forecasting. Stage: Production monitoring. Daily forecasts for 1000 series, retrain monthly.”\n\nPick a task and a stage (and any additional constraints) and I’ll return a step‑by‑step evaluation checklist with concrete metrics, data splits, statistical tests and monitoring rules.",

      "answer": "Task type: Classification (binary or multi-class)\nEvaluation stage: Development-stage (model/feature comparison)\n\nRationale:\n- Classification is the most common starting point and maps to well-established evaluation workflows (stratified cross-validation, a broad set of metrics, and straightforward baselines).\n- Development-stage focus enables systematic comparison of models and features, supports statistical significance testing, and helps identify robust, well-calibrated approaches before deployment.\n\nIf your problem is clearly time-ordered, involves ranking, forecasting, or unsupervised learning, or you already know deployment considerations, I can tailor the plan for that specific task and stage.",

It is typically measured as the proportion (or percentage) of the minority class among all labeled examples.\n\nExample calculation:  \nIf you have 1,000 total samples —\n- 950 are class A (majority)\n- 50 are class B (minority)\n\nThen, the minority class proportion = 50 / 1,000 = 0.05, or 5%.\n\nPlease provide either:\n- The exact counts of each class, or\n- The percentage or fraction of the minority class (e.g., “minority class is 3% of total examples”).\n\nThis information is critical for:\n- Selecting the right evaluation metrics (e.g., AUROC/AUPRC instead of accuracy in severe imbalance),\n- Choosing resampling or reweighting techniques,\n- Interpreting model reliability on rare outcomes.\n\nIf you are unsure, you can reply with your class counts or an estimate, and I will help you calculate and interpret the imbalance.",

      "question": "What is the primary evaluation metric you want to optimize during development-stage classification (e.g., AUROC, AUPRC, accuracy, precision/recall/F1), and do you have target thresholds or acceptable ranges for that metric (considering any class imbalance)?",
      "answer": "Short answer (pick one depending on your problem):\n\n- If binary classification with a rare positive class and you care about ranking/precision on positives: Primary metric = AUPRC (average precision).\n- If binary classification with roughly balanced classes or you care about overall ranking regardless of prevalence: Primary metric = AUROC.\n- If you must produce a hard label and care about a balanced trade-off between false positives and false negatives: Primary metric = F1 (choose macro-F1 for multiclass with imbalance, micro-F1 if you want instance-level weighting).\n- If false negatives (or false positives) dominate business cost: Primary metric = recall (or precision) at a chosen operating point.\n\nGuidance on acceptable targets and how to set them\n- Always compare to a baseline: random classifier baseline for AUPRC = prevalence p; for AUROC = 0.5. A useful rule: AUPRC should be meaningfully above p (aim for ≥2–5× p) rather than just above it.\n- Rule‑of‑thumb absolute targets (domain dependent):\n  - AUROC: 0.7 = fair, ≥0.8 = good, ≥0.9 = excellent.\n  - AUPRC: depends on prevalence — for p≈1%, AUPRC≥0.05–0.10 may already be useful; aim for ≥2–5× p and preferably ≥0.2 if possible.\n  - F1: ≥0.6 = usable, ≥0.75 = strong for many applications; require higher if decisions are critical.\n  - Precision/Recall: set concrete thresholds from business risk. Example: require recall ≥0.9 if missing positives is very costly; require precision ≥0.9 if false positives are expensive.\n- Use cost/utility to convert business needs to a numeric threshold: define costs C_FN, C_FP and choose the operating point that minimizes expected cost (or maximizes expected utility).\n\nPractical constraints and evaluation specs\n- For development-stage comparison, estimate metrics with stratified k‑fold CV (or time‑aware folds if temporal). Report mean ± 95% CI (bootstrap or CV paired tests).\n- When using AUPRC/AUROC, also report precision/recall (or sensitivity/specificity) at the chosen decision threshold, plus confusion matrix for interpretability.\n- For multiclass imbalanced problems, report per-class metrics and macro-averages; set per-class minimums for critical classes.\n- Always validate calibration if probabilities are used (Brier score, calibration plots); if poorly calibrated, re-calibrate (Platt scaling/isotonic).\n- If dataset is small or imbalance extreme, prefer AUPRC and report uncertainty; consider resampling, class weighting, or synthetic examples but evaluate on untouched hold-out.\n\nNext step\nIf you tell me: (a) binary vs multiclass, (b) prevalence of minority class, and (c) whether false negatives or false positives are costlier, I’ll give a single recommended primary metric, a concrete numeric target, and an evaluation checklist (data split, CV settings, CI method, and threshold selection rule).",
