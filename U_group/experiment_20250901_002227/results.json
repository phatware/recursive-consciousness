Otherwise, acceptance is possible if the required support threshold is met.\n- A single agent’s rejection *only* overrides group acceptance if their individual weight meets or surpasses the veto threshold.\n- If all rejecting agents are individually below the veto threshold but their total weight surpasses it, they collectively trigger a rejection.\n\n**Constraint:**  \n- There is **no compensatory averaging**: acceptances cannot make up for rejections from agents (or coalitions) with sufficient weight.\n- The precise veto/acceptance thresholds must be defined and fixed per proposal or context.\n\n**Summary:**  \nA proposal is accepted even if some agents reject it, as long as the rejecting agents’ combined weight is below the rejection threshold. A single sufficiently-weighted rejection, or a coalition that together meets the threshold, always overrides approval.",
    "[A4 Question]: Are the critical criteria selected by each agent fixed throughout all proposals (i.e., agent-defined and persistent), or can agents dynamically designate different critical criteria depending on the specific proposal being evaluated?",
    "[A1 Answer]: Agents can dynamically designate different critical criteria depending on the specific proposal being evaluated. That is, each agent may select a unique subset of critical criteria for each proposal, and these subsets can vary from one proposal to another. The system supports proposal-specific selection of critical criteria per agent; criteria are not required to be fixed or persistent across all proposals. \n\n**Constraint:**  \nFor each proposal, an agent must specify which criteria are critical for their acceptance decision in that context; there is no requirement for agents’ critical criteria to remain constant between proposals.",
    "[A2 Question]: To ensure accurate group-level aggregation, how do agents formally report their critical criteria and satisfaction ratings for each proposal—do they submit explicit binary judgments per criterion, minimum ratings over specified thresholds, or more granular numeric scores, and are these encoded in a standardized format for the aggregation procedure?",
    "[A1 Answer]: **Agents should formally report their critical criteria and satisfaction ratings for each proposal in a standardized, structured format consisting of:**\n\n1. **Critical Criteria Selection (per proposal):**  \n   - For each proposal, the agent submits an explicit list or set of criteria they declare as *critical* for their assessment of that proposal.\n   - Example encoding: `{proposal_id: ..., agent_id: ..., critical_criteria: [criterion_2, criterion_5, criterion_8]}`\n\n2. **Satisfaction Ratings (per criterion, per proposal):**  \n   - For each listed critical criterion, the agent submits a numeric satisfaction rating for that proposal-criterion pair.\n   - The rating can be:\n     - A granular numeric score on a predefined scale (e.g., 0–5 or 0–1), **or**\n     - A binary value (0 = unsatisfied, 1 = satisfied).\n   - The *minimum rating* among an agent’s critical criteria is used for their personal non-compensatory evaluation (often compared to an agent-defined or system-defined acceptance threshold per criterion).\n\n3. **Standardized Encoding for Aggregation:**  \n   - All submissions should follow a standardized machine-readable schema, such as:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"proposal_id\": \"...\",\n       \"agent_id\": \"...\",\n       \"critical_criteria\": [\n         {\n           \"criterion_id\": \"...\",\n           \"satisfaction_rating\": <numeric_or_binary_value>\n         },\n         ...\n       ]\n     }\n     ```\n   - Optionally, agents may specify per-criterion thresholds if not globally fixed.\n\n4. **Derivation of Agent-Level Acceptance:**  \n   - The aggregation procedure processes each agent’s input by:\n     - Identifying the agent’s declared set of critical criteria for the proposal.\n     - Collecting the ratings assigned to those criteria.\n     - Computing the **minimum rating across the agent’s critical criteria**; this minimum is compared to the acceptance threshold.\n     - The agent’s outcome is then encoded as a **binary accept/reject** value for the proposal (e.g., `agent_acceptance = 1/0`).\n\n5. **Summary Table Format:**\n   | Proposal ID | Agent ID | Criterion ID | Is Critical? | Satisfaction Rating | (Optional) Per-Criterion Threshold |\n   |-------------|----------|--------------|--------------|--------------------|------------------------------------|\n   | P1          | A3       | C2           | Yes          | 4                  | 3                                  |\n   | P1          | A3       | C5           | Yes          | 5                  | 3                                  |\n   | P1          | A3       | C7           | No           | (omitted/optional) |                                    |\n\n**In summary:**  \n- Agents submit, for each proposal, (a) their selected critical criteria and (b) corresponding satisfaction ratings (numeric or binary), encoded per a standardized format.\n- The system determines acceptance via minimum satisfaction among reported critical criteria (with optional per-criterion or per-agent thresholds) and outputs a binary agent-level decision for group aggregation.\n- All agent submissions must adhere to the standardized schema to ensure consistent, accurate aggregation at the group level."
