    "gt_response_A": "QUESTION: Let P1, P2, P3, ... be an infinite sequence of propositions with the property that for every n \u2265 1, Pn asserts: \"Exactly n of the propositions P1, P2, ..., Pn are true.\" Determine all possible truth-value assignments to the entire sequence that satisfy all Pn simultaneously.\n\nUNDERSTANDING: This question asks you to analyze a self-referential, infinite set of statements and identify all consistent ways to assign truth values to them. The core challenge is to reason about how the truth of each Pi depends on the truth of the preceding statements and on the count of true statements among the first i propositions.\n\nWhat the question is asking for:\n- A complete characterization of all models (truth assignments) for the infinite sequence that make every Pn true or false exactly as asserted.\n- In particular, you should determine which indices n can be true, which must be false, and how the truth values of early statements constrain later ones.\n- The task is to find all possible patterns of truth values that are internally consistent with the content of each Pi, not just a single solution.\n\nWhat constitutes a good answer:\n- Precise definitions: Let T(i) denote the number of true propositions among P1, P2, ..., Pi. Use this to formalize when Pi is true (Pi is true iff T(i) = i).\n- Logical deductions: Show that if Pi is true, then T(i) = i, which implies that P1, P2, ..., Pi are all true. Conversely, if Pi is false, then T(i) \u2260 i.\n- Inductive reasoning: Argue that if any Pi with i \u2265 2 is true, then all preceding P1, ..., Pi must be true; this leads to the conclusion that the set of indices with true Pi must form a prefix (possibly the empty prefix).\n- Exhaustive characterization: Demonstrate that the only consistent patterns are:\n  - No statements true (P1 false, and thus all Pi false by the prefix argument).\n  - A finite prefix true: P1, P2, ..., Pm are true for some m \u2265 1, and Pm+1, Pm+2, ... are false.\n  - All statements true (every Pi is true for all i, which satisfies the condition T(i) = i for every i).\n- Verification: For each proposed pattern, verify that the counts T(i) align with the truth value of Pi as defined, ensuring no hidden contradictions.\n- Optional extensions: Discuss how the analysis changes if the sequence were finite, or if the statements referred to different scopes (e.g., exactly i of the first i are true for all i up to some N, or if the statements allowed \u201cat least\u201d or \u201cat most\u201d claims). Also mention how this relates to fixed-point or self-referential reasoning in logic.\n\nA thorough answer would present:\n- A formal argument showing that true statements must occur in a contiguous prefix starting at P1, with a possible abrupt switch to all-false or all-true patterns.\n- A clear list of all consistent truth assignments (i.e., P1..Pm true and Pm+1..\u221e false for any m \u2265 0, plus the all-true case considered as m = \u221e).\n- Small explicit checks for initial cases (e.g., m = 0, m = 1, m = 2) to illustrate the pattern, followed by a general induction step.\n- A summary of the final classification of all possible models.\n\nIn essence, a good answer will formalize the problem, derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for consistency, and enumerate all and only the consistent truth-value patterns for the infinite sequence.",

The countermodel should be checked against each formalized premise, with an explanation of why each holds and why the conclusion fails. A countermodel is stronger evidence than an informal intuition that the conclusion need not follow.\n\n3. Discussion of ambiguity and alternative formalizations (part c):\n   - Identify ambiguous phrases (e.g., \u201csomeone\u201d could be constrained to be a student or any person; \u201cthey\u201d could be read distributively or collectively; does \u201cadmire every student they advise\u201d quantify only over students who are actually advised, etc.).\n   - Show at least one alternative formalization for a crucial ambiguous premise and discuss how the alternative changes whether the conclusion follows.\n   - If the premises as formalized do not entail the conclusion, propose minimal additional assumption(s) (e.g., \u201cEvery person admired by all students is admired by all professors,\u201d or \u201cFor every professor p there exists a student s such that every professor admires s,\u201d or a uniqueness/existence constraint) that would make the argument valid.

An acceptable formalization must avoid scope mistakes like mixing existential and universal quantifiers in the wrong order.\n   - State any background assumptions you use: e.g., the domain is nonempty (standard in FOL), whether Prof(x) and Stud(x) can both be true for the same x (overlap allowed unless you assume mutual exclusivity), and whether \u201cthey\u201d refers unambiguously to the professor introduced earlier.\n\n2. Correct determination of entailment (part b):\n   - If you claim the premises do entail the conclusion, give a correct formal proof. The proof method can be natural deduction, semantic tableau, resolution refutation, or sequent calculus \u2014 pick one and be rigorous about each inference step and use of premises.\n   - If you claim non-entailment, give an explicit countermodel: specify a concrete domain (often a small finite set), and give truth-values (or extension sets) for Prof, Stud, Advises, StudiesWith, and Admire so that all premises are true in the structure but the conclusion is false. The countermodel should be checked against each formalized premise, with an explanation of why each holds and why the conclusion fails. A countermodel is stronger evidence than an informal intuition that the conclusion need not follow.\n\n3. Discussion of ambiguity and alternative formalizations (part c):\n   - Identify ambiguous phrases (e.g., \u201csomeone\u201d could be constrained to be a student or any person; \u201cthey\u201d could be read distributively or collectively; does \u201cadmire every student they advise\u201d quantify only over students who are actually advised, etc.).\n   - Show at least one alternative formalization for a crucial ambiguous premise and discuss how the alternative changes whether the conclusion follows.\n   - If the premises as formalized do not entail the conclusion, propose minimal additional assumption(s) (e.g., \u201cEvery person admired by all students is admired by all professors,\u201d or \u201cFor every professor p there exists a student s such that every professor admires s,\u201d or a uniqueness/existence constraint) that would make the argument valid. Justify why each added assumption is sufficient (sketch a short proof or informal argument).\n\nCommon pitfalls and important subtle points\n- Quantifier order and scope: Mistaking \u2203y \u2200s ... for \u2200s \u2203y ... changes meaning drastically. The English \u201cadmire someone who admires every student they advise\u201d requires \u2203y (Admire(p,y) \u2227 \u2200s(... \u2192 Admire(y,s))) rather than moving \u2200s outside.\n- Distinguishing the admissible types of the \u201csomeone\u201d: is y required to be a student, professor, or any person? That affects whether premises force admiration of a student by all professors.\n- Use of premise (2): it is about \u201cadmiring all students that y admires\u201d \u2014 make sure the antecedent quantifies over students, not over all people.\n- Domain and existence: FOL semantic entailment typically assumes a single, nonempty domain; be explicit if you rely on existence of particular individuals (e.g., a professor who advises at least one student).\n- Countermodel construction strategy: to show non-entailment, typically set up a small domain with one professor and one (or more) non-student persons who serve as the \u201csomeone\u201d admired in premise (1), so professors can satisfy (1) by admiring a non-student who admires the relevant students, while no single student is admired by all professors.\n\nWhat constitutes a strong answer\n- Accurate, clearly written formalizations and explicit assumptions.\n- Either a correct proof with justified steps or a fully-specified countermodel with verification that each premise holds.\n- Thoughtful analysis of ambiguities and at least one alternative formalization showing how the logical status (entailed/non-entailed) can change.\n- If the argument is invalid, a minimal and well-justified set of extra premises that restore validity, with a brief outline of the resulting proof.\n\nOptional but valuable extras\n- If giving a proof, annotate which premise is used at each step and indicate natural deduction rules (\u2200-elimination, \u2203-introduction, modus ponens, etc.).\n- If giving a countermodel, include a small diagram or table of the domain and predicate extensions and point out which premise each feature ensures.\n- Note about decidability: entailment in FOL is semi-decidable, so mechanical methods like resolution can be used in practice; this question is intended to be solved by human-guided formal reasoning or by constructing small models.",
            "A_understanding": "- This question asks you to analyze a small natural-language theory about professors, students, and admiration, and to engage in three related tasks: (a) formalize the four premises and a candidate conclusion in first-order logic (FOL) using the given predicates; (b) determine whether the premises entail the conclusion (and provide either a rigorous entailment proof or a countermodel where premises hold but the conclusion fails); and (c) identify linguistic ambiguities in the English text, show how alternative reasonable formalizations affect entailment, and discuss what extra assumptions would make the conclusion follow in the absence of entailment.\n\n- What you need to formalize (part a):\n  - Translate each premise (1)\u2013(4) into FOL formulas using the domain of people and the predicates Prof(x), Stud(x), Advises(p,s), StudiesWith(s,p), Admire(a,b), being explicit about:\n    - the intended scope of all quantifiers (which variables are bound by \u2200 or \u2203, and in which order);\n    - how \u201csomeone\u201d or \u201cthey\u201d is to be interpreted (e.g., whether \u201csomeone\u201d must be a person with any role, or specifically a student or a professor);\n    - the exact meaning of phrases like \u201cevery student that professor advises\u201d and \u201cevery student who studies with them\u201d (and whether \u201cthem/they\u201d refers to the professor in question);\n    - any tacit background assumptions you adopt (nonempty domain, whether Prof and Stud may overlap, whether StudiesWith implies the p in the relation is a professor, etc.).\n  - Translate the conclusion: \u201cThere exists a student whom every professor admires\u201d as \u2203s [Stud(s) \u2227 \u2200p (Prof(p) \u2192 Admire(p,s))].\n\n- What you need to do for entailment (part b):\n  - Decide whether the set of four premises logically entails the conclusion. You have two standard options:\n    - Provide a correct formal proof (natural deduction, sequent calculus, resolution, etc.) that, from (1)\u2013(4), derives the conclusion.\n    - Or, provide a countermodel: a concrete structure (domain of people, interpretations of Prof, Stud, Advises, StudiesWith, Admire) that satisfies all four premises but falsifies the conclusion.\n  - If you claim entailment, present a clear, step-by-step justification. If you claim non-entailment, give a concrete counterexample model and verify each premise holds while the conclusion fails.\n  - Be explicit about how any apparent vacuity, e.g., if no professor advises anyone, would affect the argument, and how (4) interacts with (1)\u2013(3).\n\n- What you need to discuss in ambiguities and alternatives (part c):\n  - Identify natural-language ambiguities that affect formalization and entailment, such as:\n    - the scope of \u201csomeone\u201d in (1) and whether that someone must be a student or can be any person;\n    - the referent of \u201cthey/them\u201d in phrases like \u201cstudies with them\u201d or \u201cevery student that professor advises\u201d (does \u201cthem\u201d refer to the particular professor in question?);\n    - whether Prof(x) and Stud(x) can both hold for the same individual (overlap allowed or prohibited);\n    - whether the domain is assumed nonempty and whether there must be at least one professor, one student, etc.\n    - whether StudiesWith(s,p) already encodes that p is a professor, or whether you must enforce Prof(p) in the relevant quantifications.\n  - Show how at least two reasonable alternative formalizations would differ, and explain how those differences could change whether the conclusion follows.\n  - If, under your preferred formalization, the premises do not entail the conclusion, propose the weakest plausible additional assumption(s) that would make the conclusion follow, and give a brief justification for why those assumptions suffice (and how they are used in a sketch of a proof).\n\n- What constitutes a good answer:\n  - Clear, explicit formalizations for (1)\u2013(4) and the conclusion, with carefully annotated quantifier structure and scope.\n  - A precise decision about entailment, including either a rigorous proof or a well-checked countermodel, and clear explanations of how each premise is satisfied or violated in the model.\n  - A thoughtful discussion of ambiguities, with at least one concrete alternative formalization and an explanation of how that alters the outcome.\n  - If needed, a proposal of the minimal additional assumption(s) that would yield entailment, with a brief justification and a sketch of how the proof would proceed under that assumption.\n\n- Common subtleties to watch out for:\n  - Quantifier order and scope (e.g., \u2203y \u2200s vs. \u2200s \u2203y) can invert meaning drastically in statements like \u201cadmire someone who admires every student they advise.\u201d\n  - Whether \u201csomeone\u201d or the antecedent of \u201cthey\u201d is constrained to be a student or a professor, or any person.\n  - The treatment of domain elements that are not Professors or not Students; whether you need to add explicit constraints like \u2200p (Prof(p) \u2192 \u2026) or \u2200s (Stud(s) \u2192 \u2026).\n  - The possibility of vacuous truth making premises true even when an intended existential condition (e.g., existence of a professor who advises at least one student) is not guaranteed by the premises alone.\n\n- In short, this is a standard exercise in careful translation of natural language into FOL, analyzing scope and assumptions, and testing logical consequence via proofs or countermodels, with a substantial emphasis on recognizing ambiguities that affect the logical outcome.",
            "question": "QUESTION:  \nLet the domain be people, and let the following predicates be given: Prof(x) (x is a professor), Stud(x) (x is a student), Advises(p,s) (professor p advises student s), StudiesWith(s,p) (student s studies with professor p), Admire(a,b) (person a admires person b).

If the original premises do not entail the conclusion, state the weakest plausible additional assumption(s) that would make the conclusion follow and briefly justify why.\n\nUNDERSTANDING:  \nWhat this question is asking for, and how to approach it\n\nIntent and context:\n- The question probes skills in (i) accurately translating nuanced natural-language statements into first-order logic with quantifiers and predicates, (ii) checking logical entailment between premises and a candidate conclusion, and (iii) diagnosing how small changes in formalization or extra assumptions affect logical consequence. It combines syntactic tasks (formalization, proof) with semantic tasks (model construction, counterexamples) and invites reflection on linguistic ambiguity that matters for logical analysis.\n\nWhat a good answer must include\n1. Precise formalizations (part a):\n   - Show one clear FOL formula for each premise and for the conclusion. Be explicit about variable names, quantifier scopes, and connectives. For example, for premise (1) you should indicate that the \u201csomeone\u201d admired by the professor may be any person y (not necessarily a student) and that \u201cevery student they advise\u201d binds the student variable relative to that professor.

The countermodel should be checked against each formalized premise, with an explanation of why each holds and why the conclusion fails. A countermodel is stronger evidence than an informal intuition that the conclusion need not follow.\n\n3. Discussion of ambiguity and alternative formalizations (part c):\n   - Identify ambiguous phrases (e.g., \u201csomeone\u201d could be constrained to be a student or any person; \u201cthey\u201d could be read distributively or collectively; does \u201cadmire every student they advise\u201d quantify only over students who are actually advised, etc.).\n   - Show at least one alternative formalization for a crucial ambiguous premise and discuss how the alternative changes whether the conclusion follows.\n   - If the premises as formalized do not entail the conclusion, propose minimal additional assumption(s) (e.g., \u201cEvery person admired by all students is admired by all professors,\u201d or \u201cFor every professor p there exists a student s such that every professor admires s,\u201d or a uniqueness/existence constraint) that would make the argument valid. Justify why each added assumption is sufficient (sketch a short proof or informal argument).\n\nCommon pitfalls and important subtle points\n- Quantifier order and scope: Mistaking \u2203y \u2200s ... for \u2200s \u2203y ... changes meaning drastically. The English \u201cadmire someone who admires every student they advise\u201d requires \u2203y (Admire(p,y) \u2227 \u2200s(... \u2192 Admire(y,s))) rather than moving \u2200s outside.\n- Distinguishing the admissible types of the \u201csomeone\u201d: is y required to be a student, professor, or any person?

Grammatically and naturally, \u201csomeone\u201d need not be a student unless the sentence says so; both readings are reasonable and lead to different formalizations. Either reading is defensible; you must pick one when formalizing. Below I give the two natural formalizations and show how each affects entailment (in both cases the premises as stated do NOT force the conclusion).\n\n1) Two precise formalizations of premise (1)\n\n- Unrestricted \u201csomeone\u201d (y can be any person):\n  \u2200p [ Prof(p) \u2227 (\u2203s (Stud(s) \u2227 Advises(p,s)))\n       \u2192 \u2203y ( Admire(p,y) \u2227 \u2200s (Advises(p,s) \u2192 Admire(y,s)) ) ].\n  (Here y ranges over all people; no constraint Stud(y).)\n\n- Restricted \u201csomeone\u201d (y must be a student):\n  \u2200p [ Prof(p) \u2227 (\u2203s (Stud(s) \u2227 Advises(p,s)))\n       \u2192 \u2203y ( Stud(y) \u2227 Admire(p,y) \u2227 \u2200s (Advises(p,s) \u2192 Admire(y,s)) ) ].\n\nWhich you choose matters. I use the same formalizations for the other premises and the conclusion:\n\n- (2) \u2200x\u2200y [ (\u2200s (Stud(s) \u2227 Admire(y,s) \u2192 Admire(x,s))) \u2192 Admire(x,y) ].\n  (If x admires every student that y admires, then x admires y.)\n\n- (3) \u2203p [ Prof(p) \u2227 \u2200s ( (Stud(s) \u2227 StudiesWith(s,p)) \u2192 Advises(p,s) ) ].\n\n- (4) \u2200s ( Stud(s) \u2192 \u2203p (Prof(p) \u2227 StudiesWith(s,p)) ).\n\n- Conclusion: \u2203s ( Stud(s) \u2227 \u2200p (Prof(p) \u2192 Admire(p,s)) ).\n\n2) Why the distinction matters (countermodels)\n\nI give one concrete countermodel for each reading showing the premises can all be true while the conclusion is false.\n\nA. Countermodel when \u201csomeone\u201d may be any person\n- Domain D = {p1, p2, s1}.\n- Prof = {p1, p2}. Stud = {s1}.\n- Advises = {(p1,s1)}.\n- StudiesWith = {(s1,p1)}.\n- Admire = {(p1,p2), (p2,s1)}. (So p1 admires p2; p2 admires s1; p1 does not admire s1.)\nCheck:\n  - (1) holds for p1: p1 advises s1 and admires p2, and p2 admires s1, so \u2203y = p2 satisfies the inner condition. p2 does not advise any student, so (1) is vacuous for p2.\n  - (2) holds vacuously: there is no pair (x,y) with x actually admiring every student that y admires except trivial vacuous cases.\n  - (3) p1 advises every student who studies with p1 (s1).\n  - (4) s1 studies with p1.\n  - Conclusion is false: only student is s1 and p1 does not admire s1, so no student is admired by every professor.\nThus with the unrestricted reading (someone can be any person) the premises do not force the conclusion.\n\nB. Countermodel when \u201csomeone\u201d must be a student\n- Domain D = {p1, p2, a, b}.\n- Prof = {p1, p2}. Stud = {a, b}.\n- Advises = {(p1,a), (p1,b)}.\n- StudiesWith = {(a,p1),(b,p1)}.\n- Admire = {(p1,a), (a,a), (a,b)}. (So a admires both students; p1 admires a; p2 admires nobody.)\nCheck:\n  - (1) (restricted): p1 advises a,b and admires student a; a admires a and b, so \u2203y = a works. p2 does not advise anyone, so (1) vacuous there.\n  - (2) holds vacuously (no x admires all students a admires).\n  - (3) p1 advises all students who study with p1 (a and b).\n  - (4) each student studies with p1.\n  - Conclusion false: p2 admires no student, so there is no student admired by every professor.\nSo even if you require the \u201csomeone\u201d to be a student, the premises still do not entail the conclusion.\n\n3) Practical guidance and consequences\n- Default interpretation: ordinary English \u201csomeone\u201d = \u201csome person,\u201d so the unrestricted formalization is the standard literal reading. If the writer intended that the \u201csomeone\u201d must be a student they should have written \u201cadmire some student who\u2026\u201d.\n- Logical effect: restricting \u201csomeone\u201d to be a student makes premise (1) stronger, but it is not strong enough (with the other given premises) to force the existence of a student admired by every professor. You need further assumptions to derive the conclusion.\n- Minimal plausible extra assumptions that would make the conclusion follow (examples):\n  - Strengthen (1) to a uniform student: \u2203y Stud(y) \u2227 \u2200p(Prof(p) \u2227 \u2203s(Stud(s) \u2227 Advises(p,s)) \u2192 Admire(p,y) \u2227 \u2200s(Advises(p,s) \u2192 Admire(y,s))). (This asserts the same student y works for every advising professor; then the conclusion follows immediately.)\n  - Or assume every professor advises at least one student AND every person who admires all students is admired by every professor: \u2200y( (\u2200s(Stud(s) \u2192 Admire(y,s))) \u2192 \u2200p(Prof(p) \u2192 Admire(p,y)) ). Combined with (3)+(4) one might be able to manufacture such a y and get the conclusion.\n  - Another plausible addition: \u201cFor every professor p, the student y that p admires (from (1)) is the same across all professors\u201d \u2014 equivalent to the first strengthening.\n\nSummary answer to your precise question: No, English does not force \u201csomeone\u201d to be a student \u2014 it can be any person. If you want \u201csomeone\u201d to be a student you must make that explicit in the formalization; the two readings are both natural and lead to different FOL formulas. In either reading, however, the given four premises as stated do not entail \u201cthere exists a student whom every professor admires\u201d (see the countermodels above).",

Both choices are logically possible; you should pick and declare one when you formalize.

State which direction if you want asymmetric rules.\n\n2) How the choice affects meaning and modelling\n- Conceptually: natural domains vary. In many real settings people can be both students and professors (graduate student instructors, visiting students who teach). In other contexts \u201cprofessor\u201d and \u201cstudent\u201d are meant to be exclusive roles. English here is ambiguous; you must decide based on the intended scenario.\n- Formally: making Prof and Stud disjoint or allowing overlap can change which models are admitted, and so can change whether particular conclusions follow from premises. It does not, by itself, resolve the main entailment question here unless you add stronger role-mapping axioms.\n\n3) Effect on the entailment in this problem\n- Neither assuming disjointness nor allowing overlap, by itself, makes the given premises entail \u201c\u2203s (Stud(s) \u2227 \u2200p(Prof(p) \u2192 Admire(p,s)))\u201d.

Premises (1)\u2013(4) true, conclusion false.\n  - Example with overlap: you can similarly produce a model where someone is both Prof and Stud and the premises hold while the conclusion fails \u2014 disallowing overlap is not the key missing assumption needed to derive the conclusion.\n\n4) Recommendation\n- Keep Prof and Stud independent in your formalization unless the text explicitly rules out overlap. Explicitly state your choice (either include \u2200x(Prof(x)\u2192\u00acStud(x)) or state no such axiom).\n- If you need the conclusion to follow you will likely need a stronger, explicit extra axiom (e.g. require the witness in (1) be a student, or that the same student is admired by every professor), not merely disjointness.\n\nIf you want, I can (a) show the two formalizations of the premises with the exclusivity axiom added, or (b) produce small concrete countermodels that respect either disjointness or overlap.

The common, safe default in many logic exercises is to assume disjointness (Prof(x) and Stud(x) cannot both hold). If you choose that, include \u2200x (Prof(x) \u2192 \u00acStud(x)) (and if you want a full partition, add \u2200x (Prof(x) \u2228 Stud(x)) \u2227 \u2200x \u00ac(Prof(x) \u2227 Stud(x)).\n  - If you keep overlap allowed, be mindful of potential degenerate cases (e.g., a student who is also a professor) when formulating and evaluating premises.",

            "B_response": "Short answer\n\n- In standard first\u2011order logic (the usual semantics taught in logic courses) the domain is assumed nonempty. But whether it contains any professors or students is not assumed a priori \u2014 that depends on the predicate extensions and the premises.\n\n- From the premises as written, (3) (\u2203p Prof(p) \u2227 \u2026) guarantees at least one professor exists. None of the premises logically forces the existence of a student: (4) is a universal conditional and is vacuously true if there are no students. So the premises do not by themselves guarantee that any Stud(x) holds.\n\nNotes and consequences\n\n- If you want to model the intended scenario where students definitely exist, make that explicit (add \u2203s Stud(s) or strengthen (3) to require the professor to advise at least one student, e.g. \u2203p[Prof(p) \u2227 \u2203s(Stud(s) \u2227 StudiesWith(s,p) \u2227 Advises(p,s))]).\n\n- If you allow an empty domain (some formal treatments allow this), then existential premises like (3) would fail; most standard FOL semantics disallow empty domains precisely to avoid such pathologies.\n\nRecommendation\n\n- Use the standard convention: assume a nonempty domain, but explicitly state (or add) \u2203s Stud(s) or a stronger existence axiom if you need students to exist for the argument to reflect the intended reading.",
            "A_response": "- Short answer: In standard first-order logic, the domain is assumed non-empty. From the premises you have, premise (3) already guarantees at least one professor exists, so the domain must contain a professor.

Therefore, the domain need not contain a student, though it may if you choose to include one or more.\n\n- More precise points:\n  - Domain non-emptiness: generally assumed; here it is actually implied by (3) since it asserts the existence of a professor.\n  - Existence of professors vs. students: there must be at least one professor, but there need not be any students unless you add a separate existential premise like \u2203x Stud(x).\n  - Overlap/disjointness: nothing in the premises requires Prof(x) and Stud(x) to be disjoint; you may assume either overlap is allowed or impose disjointness (e.g., \u2200x (Prof(x) \u2192 \u00acStud(x))) if you want to force separation.\n  - If you want the conclusion \u201cthere exists a student whom every professor admires\u201d to be meaningful in all models, you should add a premise asserting the existence of at least one student.",

It matches the plain English phrase and is the reading used earlier in our formalizations and countermodels. Allowing multiple professors per student makes the premises weaker and makes it easier to build countermodels that falsify the conclusion.\n\n- \u201cAt most one\u201d or \u201cexactly one\u201d are stronger constraints (fewer models). They can rule out certain countermodels, but uniqueness alone typically does not by itself make the original premises entail the conclusion. For instance, even if each student studies with exactly one professor, professors could still admire non-students as witnesses in (1), so you can still often construct models where no single student is admired by every professor unless you add further axioms forcing the witnesses in (1) to be students or otherwise tie admiration to students globally.\n\nRecommendation\n\n- Use the plain \u201cat least one\u201d formalization unless you have independent reason to assume uniqueness. If you do assume uniqueness, state it explicitly with the \u2203! or the \u201cat most one\u201d + \u201cat least one\u201d sentences so readers know the stronger modelling choice.",
