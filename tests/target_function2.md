# Function Overview

1. **Name**: `process_advanced_payment`
2. **Purpose**: Handles payment transactions with support for multiple transaction types (credit, debit, refund, transfer), currency conversion, tier-based limits, fraud checks, and audit logging.
3. **Inputs**:
- `user_id`: Integer user identifier.
- `amount`: Float transaction amount in source currency.
- `source_currency`: String (e.g., "USD", "EUR").
- `target_currency`: String for destination currency.
- `account_balance`: Float user balance in source currency.
- `transaction_type`: String ("credit", "debit", "refund", "transfer").
- `is_fraud_flagged`: Boolean indicating fraud detection.
- `user_tier`: String ("basic", "premium", "enterprise") for limit rules.
4. **Returns**: String status ("Success" or error message).
5. **Features**:
- Validates inputs and transaction types.
- Applies currency conversion using a mock exchange rate table.
- Enforces tier-based transaction limits.
- Logs audit events to a file.
- Checks for blocked users and fraud.

### Intentional Bugs and Flaws

1. **Bug**: Currency conversion uses a hardcoded exchange rate table that doesn't handle missing currency pairs, causing a `KeyError` for unsupported currencies.
2. **Bug**: The audit log file is opened in write mode (`"w"`), overwriting previous logs on each call, leading to data loss.
3. **Bug**: For refunds, the amount is added to the balance without checking if the original transaction exists, allowing unlimited refunds.
4. **Bug**: The `user_tier` check for limits uses case-sensitive comparison, so "Premium" fails validation.
5. **Logical Inconsistency**: The fraud check occurs after balance updates, potentially processing fraudulent transactions before rejection.
6. **Assumption**: Assumes `amount` is always positive, but negative amounts could bypass validation for certain transaction types (e.g., transfers).
7. **Scalability Issue**: Blocked user list is hardcoded and checked with a linear search, inefficient for large lists.
8. **Error Handling**: Mixes exceptions and status strings, with some errors unhandled, causing crashes.
9. **Improvement Opportunity**: Lacks input type validation: non-numeric `amount` or `account_balance` causes runtime errors.
10. **Improvement Opportunity**: No logging of currency conversion rates for audit trail, hindering debugging.

## Expected Debugger Findings

### Bugs

- KeyError for unsupported currency pairs.
- Audit log file overwritten each time.
- Unchecked refund amounts.
- Case-sensitive user tier validation.
- Late fraud check.

### Improvements

- Add type validation for numeric inputs.
- Use append mode for audit logging.
- Implement recipient validation for transfers.
- Use a database for blocked users.
- Log currency conversion rates.
